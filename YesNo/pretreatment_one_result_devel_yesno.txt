Q2685_C1	As far as I know there is no As far as I know there is no terrestrial broadcast in Qatar, everyone uses satellite pointed at Arab Sat and Nile Sat etc. So a digital terrestrial receiver attached to an aerial will not work.

Q2690	I just lost my wallet in a Shopping Center.. I just lost my wallet, somebody stole it in my back pocket. Is there any way i can retrieve all my id's and license? nevermind about the money.. all i care about are my id's.. :(  I really thought those kind of people doesn't exist here in Doha.. :(
Q2690_C1	RE: I just lost my wallet in a Shopping Center.. there is a different route to retrieve each type of i.d. for the qatar i.d. you first have to report it missing with the capitol police station which i believe is by souq waqf. after 7 days you go back and they will give you a paper to go and get another i.d. for the driving license, go to the traffic department that issues these, pay 100 i think it is and you'll get another one on the spot. just remember to take your passport and any other pertinent i.d. to each of these places so as not to make a wasted trip. this happened to me before, wallet was stolen out of my locked car!

While DUPLICATE QID you can get it from SOUQ WAQIF, Airport, Mesaimeer Branch of MOI service stations . Be careful next time as CORRUPTION and poverty is increasing day by day in all parts of the world
Q2690_C6	RE: I just lost my wallet in a Shopping Center.. Don't listen to Da Count! Doha is a great place, it's just that sometimes things like this happen! It's people like him that probably stole your wallet. I am sure the police will be more than helpful to retrieve your valuables or at least assist you in gaining new ones. Da Count, your people are known for stealing things, so you should be more sympathetic to this person.

Jordanians, Iraqis, Palestinians (from abroad) and indians too as they always try to regulate the ratios of nationalities in the country.
Q2708_C8	Cumbersome this rule was Cumbersome this rule was actually passed just a couple of days ago so it seems. I'm talking about visit visa being stopped completely for everyone, not any specific nationality. Both persons that told me this went to the airport branch.

Q2716_C2	RE: Somebody hit my car / will i get insurance? no. you have to pay for the repair after you get the police report since your insurance is t.p.l. only

Q2716_C5	RE: Somebody hit my car / will i get insurance? If you dont know who hits you, then you are responsible to go to police dept. to make a report for the damage and you'll pay 110.  They will check also if you have any violation (if you have, sadly you have to pay it or else you're not gonna get the report). Since its only TPL, sadly (again) you will bear the expenses for the repair.

Q2717	cheerios??? can you find cheerios in Doha???
Q2717_C1	Don't get me wrong doody. I Don't get me wrong doody. I myself have honey cheerios at home which I on occasion eat cause they're quite tasty. What I meant to say, though it didn't come across properly, was that the advertising campaign that Nestle cheerios has is over exaggerated.  Companies like nestle tend to amplify what little nutritional value their products have to convince consumers to buy them. Like expat sueno says, they are a bit healthier than the other stuff out there but at the same time they're still not that healthy. Anyway I don't mean to be a diet Nazi, you should eat what you wish :) Oh and I have to agree with Doratheexplorer, I'm not sure about giving cheerios to a baby you'd have to check up on that.
Q2717_C2	Cheerios I saw them on sunday in Megamart
Q2717_C3	There was also some at There was also some at Shoprite.  Motherhood...The hardest job you'll ever love! : )
Q2717_C4	cheerios The Honey Nut Cheerios almost always seem to be in stock at MegaMart - at least when I go.  The regular Cheerios are more difficult to find, but they do exist.  (Buy them up when you can find them!)  Keep in mind that the Honey Nut Cheerios have a lot of sugar (9g per serving) compared to the regular Cheerios (1g per serving) http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/news/20081001/kids-cereals-some-are-50-percent-sugar  They're not as bad as some other cereals that target kids, but they're still quite sweet.
Q2717_C5	thank you all for the thank you all for the inputs... i hope i'll get to find those regular cheerios
Q2717_C6	Cheerios and Honey Cheerios So funny that you asked because I've been looking for them for a while too.  Here's my info:  1.  Regular, plain cheerios:  I've only found them at Megamart.  And they cost like 23 riyals for a very small box!  2.  Honey Cheerios (from Nestle):  These are available at just about every grocery store like Family Food Centre, Food Palace, Lulu, Carrefour.  They only cost around 13 riyals for a box.  Hope this helps.
Q2717_C7	I was going to write the I was going to write the same thing as NY couple. In Family food centre you can occassionally get vanilla cheerios which do well on the taste buds but are a bit on the expensive side - like 35 riyals.
Q2717_C8	Oh and don't buy into that Oh and don't buy into that wholegrain healthy crap that all these cereals advertised. They're all still pretty heavily processed. Best healthiest thing to do for breakfast is eat as much protein as you can - hence eggs are highly recommended.
Q2717_C9	you're right to an extent, villagejoker Cheerios are processed - absolutely.  However, on an overall basis they're much healthier than most of the other garbage out there that is marketed to mums for their babies & toddlers.  The sugar content of plain ol' Cheerios is also far lower than that of sugared cereals and other snacks, which are generally even more processed than Cheerios.  Some of the sugared cereals are up to 50% sugar (by weight - and more than that as a % of calories).    Even some of the yogurts have more grams of sugar per serving than a full-sized can of Coke, thanks to all the added sugar (and high fructose corn syrup).  Plain unsweetened/unflavored yogurt does contain natural sugar, as does fruit, but nowhere near the sugar levels of the typical "fruit" yogurt here in Qatar.  Nothing is ever truly perfect in the snack food world, but we can strive for "the best we can find". . .I just try to read the labels and use common sense :o)
Q2717_C10	Rizks Cheerios is a cereal name brand.  I'd check Mega Mart.  There are many western products in stock there.  Prepare to pay out the wazoo for them though!

Q2797_C4	qdc permit do ask your company in advance i do know that there are a few companys out there that are not willing to give a permit to expats
Q2797_C5	"What has muslim got to do "What has muslim got to do with this thread"  1. Alcohol is restricted because Qatar is officially a Muslim country.  2. Muslims are prohibited (by law anyway) from having a liquor or pork license and are not supposed to be served at hotel bars.  We all know, of course, that many people find their way around it.  MODS--please take a note of this purposeful oversensitivity and baiting.   To the OP--it's easily obtainable, but expensive.

Q2797_C18	I AGREE WITH @ Bauchus  I AGREE WITH U THAT THE REACTION WAS OVERLY SENSETIVE!  But just to clarify...Muslims are not prohibited by law to from having alcohol although they used to be....now a day they r prohibited from acquiring a license to purchase it for home use but they still  can "LEGALLY" consume alcohol at any of the bars in town, many of which requiring memberships and none of which can legally reject any person for being a Muslim  I know that because what ur saying "used to be" true and it was abolished about 3 yrs ago and announced in all bars due to an insident that happened at Irish bar at Sheraton...since then all Muslims can drink legally if they choose to do so at any establishment
Q2797_C19	Thanks for the clarification Thanks for the clarification super cool.  It always struck me as impossible for hotels enquire about someone's religion before serving a drink; good to know they aren't expected to do it.

Q2799	Can an Emirate national get a liquor permit? Can an Emirate National get an alcohol permit?
Q2799_C1	RE: Can an Emirate national get a liquor permit? My guess would be no as you need to show your QATAR ID to get one
Q2799_C2	RE: Can an Emirate national get a liquor permit? Call QDC tel: 44699413
Q2799_C3	RE: Can an Emirate national get a liquor permit? Yes, you can get the liquor license if you hold a valid RP in QATAR. You just need a letter from your sponsor stating your designation with your salary (All Allowances Must Be Included), Copy of RP from your passport, QR.1000/- (One time deposit)..  Go to QDC, fill up the form, submit all the above. If approved, you will be granted the permit in 15min.
Q2799_C4	RE: Can an Emirate national get a liquor permit? I dont think so brother
Q2799_C5	RE: Can an Emirate national get a liquor permit? Of course assuming you are a muslim, I think you have no chance of getting a liquor license.  Not sure about Qatar, but I know of a friend of mine that has an Australian passport, but he is a muslim, and they refused a license to him in the UAE.  I would think unless you can provide proof to the authorities that you are not muslim, then you will have no success.   Of course, I could be wrong, but I doubt it in this case.
Q2799_C6	RE: Can an Emirate national get a liquor permit? are u out of ur mind?? dont u have a littel dignity or shame?? is this the image u want to give about muslims? if u a muslim dont follow ur religion and stick to it how do u expext others to respect u and respect ur religion and convince them about it???? sooooo shocked and ur from emirates????waw what do ur parents think???

Q2819_C5	@ smoke justin is the half brother of shannon and janice but shanon and janice are not related, not sharing any parent in common.
Q2819_C6	wat about half sister ? :(  wat about her second half ?
Q2819_C7	I always wonder!!! Are such comments out of not understanding the question or out of showing off the languistic skills?  Half sister would be a sister from another father/mother or sister-in-law.  Jentizon, As far as I know this would be dificult and most probably she will need to come on tourism visa; but better to wait for more experienced answer or why not giving it a try.
Q2819_C8	and hislam stop wondering !  and help the chap buddy !
Q2819_C9	BTW - Half Sister means Step BTW - Half Sister means Step Sister....  Ok as to the question i dont think it will be possible cuz if my knowledge serves me right you both have to have the same last name or family name to be able to get it but i think you can get a tourist visa  check the following links for more info  http://www.moi.gov.qa/site/english/departments/PassportDept/sections/sec748/748.html  http://portal.www.gov.qa/wps/portal/services

Q2831	Is studying in Pensylvannia safe?? I am thinking of studying there, but.. hesitated a bit; so.. is it safe??
Q2831_C1	RE: Is studying in Pensylvannia safe?? In the daytime yes.... But be aware that at night the Amish roam.... with pitchforks and horse drawn buggies!!!!  Seriously PA is kinda big. You need to be more specific...
Q2831_C2	RE: Is studying in Pensylvannia safe?? yes its very safe  if you do not get around bad people, then u can spend the rest of ur life in the US without any problem.
Q2831_C3	RE: Is studying in Pensylvannia safe?? It can be as safe or dangerous as you want it to be. Having spent 20 + years in the USA, I would say it is safe. Like someone else said, PA is large, where are you going to study? It is a beautiful state, with gorgeous rural areas, bustling city, and lots to do. Outdoor activities are great; it is a hop-skip-and-jump to the New Jersey shore, New York City, and not far to get to Montreal in Canada. I would say if you have the opportunity, you may as well do it.

If you both act on a low profile the neighbors..will not complain, just state to your neighbors that you are married,, they will not know the wiser,. But as stated it is illegal, friends of mine where caught, they were put in by their neighbors. Some people have great satisfaction in reporting you to the police. As some say they pay spotters to find incidents like this, it is the fastest way to get promoted in the ranks.. It also depends on your race as well Just keep a low profile and get an apartment in a compound with a lot of westerners.  But is it worth loosing your job and going to jail over.. i think not

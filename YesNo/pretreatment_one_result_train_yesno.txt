Q10	is there any temple in qatar ...... Hi, as most indians live in qatar.... is there any temple in qatar.....
Q10_C1	RE: is there any temple in qatar ...... http://www.qatarliving.com/answers/living-in-qatar/any-hindu-temple  write temple on the search at  the right hand side u will find many threads on this topic..............
Q10_C2	RE: is there any temple in qatar ...... Qatar is basically an islamic country and they see asian expats as slaves and nothi8ng more. So u may see churches here but you wont find temples. And idol worship is not allowed in islam. Hence you wont find temples here. I hope one day qatar changes the attitude of seeing asians as slaves.
Q10_C3	RE: is there any temple in qatar ...... Shayampsundar....... You are prejudiced against Qatar............ why not you leave this country if your religious sentiments are being bashed..... as you claim!! Asians are slave??????????? Are you treating yourself as a leader of again community here.  Beware such statements can lead to your deportation also....... i know you are still a kid ( based on your profile)...... but refrain from unworthy comments...... otherwise this would lead to problem for your parents who are earning their livelihood here and feeding you!!!
Q10_C4	RE: is there any temple in qatar ...... SHYAM SUNDER....  are they treating u as a slave or do u consider yourself to be a rotten slave....coz i do not think that any one here has bothered to chain ur legs to some shackles here and kept u bonded...u are here just for your some meaningful gains and u are making yourself a slave to the country..like any respect a human being deserves everyone has the freedom to choose to stay or go away from a place he likes or dislikes...so if u do not like the systems here y the hell are u making urself a slave or a DOG over here...get lost man to ur own country and iam sure wherever u go u will definitely treat others as slaves..so cheers
Q10_C5	RE: is there any temple in qatar ...... shayampsundar, u have the right to speak out and give ur comment or suggestion but u should respect Qatar or the relegion Islam!by giving comments to ur brother..... if somebody treated u as slave don't generalized all the locals or Qatari/we all know most indians was lazy and trying hard/they think that they know everything but we know that their really something/talkative and staburn...

Q66	Car Transfer One of my friend is on visit visa in Qatar, he got permanent Qatari Driving license, can he buy car on his name though he dont have Residence visa?
Q66_C1	RE: Car Transfer How did he get a Qatari Driving License (permanent) without having a Residence Permit and ID?
Q66_C2	RE: Car Transfer cherukkan, He might have got the temporary DL and is confused. They will not issue Permanent DL without RP and ID.   A person on visit visa will not have a Permanent DL of Qatar and will not be able to buy a car.
Q66_C3	RE: Car Transfer please get your facts straight as you cannot get a Permanent Drivers License without an RP. The license is link to your QID and bear the same number.
Q66_C4	RE: Car Transfer the license is connected to the Qatari ID.. if the visa is cancelled the license will have no meaning as well.. he is driving at his own risk similar to not having a license.. if he gets a new sponsor and gets a new qatari id he will again need to apply for a new license to be linked to that new ID.
Q66_C5	RE: Car Transfer Dohamarketing is right. You don't need a Driving License to buy a car but you need an RP to buy a car. His Driving License is invalid as his visa was cancelled and he should renew it after obtaining the RP.

Q78	Mixed info re driving licence Before everyone shouts at me - I did a search and the info seems to be a bit old.(2006-2007) So at the risk of being ridiculed - can I just ask a simple question?  Can I rent a car with an international driving license while waiting for my residency permit? Even if I have been here longer than 7 days?   Its all very confusing!
Q78_C1	RE: Mixed info re driving licence I came to Qatar and rent a car with my International Driving license until my RP was ready,if u want I can give you the office name i rented the car from.  So irresponsible answers from the mentioned person should be ignored.  Good luck my friend , Enjoy Qatar it is a lovely country.
Q78_C2	RE: Mixed info re driving licence Hello friend,you can rent a car no problem... But becarefull with radars and traffic camera s Welcome to Qatar and enjoy its beauty.
Q78_C3	RE: Mixed info re driving licence yes no problem. i used my international licence for 10 months with a rental. even had an accident and had no problem at traffic dept with that licence.
Q78_C4	RE: Mixed info re driving licence Yes no problem, did exactly that when we arrived, but make sure you convert to a Qatari Driving license as soon as your RP is processed

Q84	Canon Dealer / supplier in Washington Hello QL friends,  Does any one have any information of a well reputed Canon Camera's Dealer/Supplier in Washington?
Q84_C1	well as we all know tht the well as we all know tht the prices here are way to expensive thn in US, that is the onl reason i was looking out for a dealer in Washington, i was in touch with a dealer in NY who is also accosiated with Amazon, who had given me a good price for the camera and the lense, but the only problem is tht i am bit nervous in having it shipped out via courier, but then when a friend of mine told me tht he is flying to washington and if i cud find a reputed dealer in there he could pick it up for me and for sure will be cheaper as i can save on the customs duty and the courier charges.  That is the only reason.

Q84_C5	Actually I thought this was some kind of a joke, the south pole is very far away for us to buy a camera delivering it to Qatar would really cost more than the camera itself, come on guys you made me feel guilty. My bad. :(
Q84_C6	No issues, blood, atleast you No issues, blood, atleast you ere kind enough to reply back to the post.
Q84_C7	Blood, the problem is that Blood, the problem is that for high end cameras, it's still cheaper  including delivery to get them shipped from USA, than it is to buy them here.  I bought my 5D on holiday in KL and a friends 7D in HK - they both worked out about 1/2 price compared to Doha
Q84_C8	i can tell About the south pole dealer if interested, I even might be able to get a special discount too.

Q115	Can i work in qatar under my fathers sponsorship? i want to work in qatar for few months and then i may go outside qatar for my further studies ..........i applied here in some companies but they will give me job only if i change my sponsor............................  is dere any solution fo this
Q115_C1	RE: Can i work in qatar under my fathers sponsorship? technically you can't work under your father's sponsorship But you can transfer your sponsorship to whichever employer even if your employer does not have a visa of your specific nationality, its easier that way But if and when you do a transfer, you have to be careful because specific nationalities such as Jordanian for instance can be denied a transfer in which case you may end up in trouble...

Q118_C2	I work for the government I work for the government and all my Qatari counterparts make the same as I do.... in all the departments based on grade and we are more than 1000 employees. Private companies may differ but anything on a grade all the salaries are the same or within a specific range. Only difference is the social allowance, which I dont get but as they are Qataris they dont get housing.... With my housing allowance I actually make more than my Qatari counterparts.   As for their inflated titles, thats a different story. I have a person in a position above me who gets to sit and read the paper all day and make double my salary... thats something different all togther.   _______________________________________________________ "Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"

Q189	Will 8000QAR per month enough? I work in the UK on a salary of 17,000GBP after tax. I have a feeling my company will be offering me a comparable salary to work in Qatar.  This does not include any benefits, so i will have to pay for accomadation etc. I am a British citizen, 23 and single so i do not need anything too lavish.   What do you fine citizens of QL think?
Q189_C1	not enough No way near enough if you have to pay your own accomodation.  check QL classifieds to get an idea of the going rate for apartments.  EVERYTHING here is more expensive, except for petrol.  You need to be making a good deal more than you were in the UK.
Q189_C2	Are you sure its QR.8000? A Are you sure its QR.8000? A decent single bed apartment cost 4000 to 5000..whats left? for a car you will have to pay 2000 per month.. so its too less...    <a href="http://s434.photobucket.com/albums/qq67/formattedsoul/?action=view&current=0003.gif" target="_blank"><img src="http://i434.photobucket.com/albums/qq67/formattedsoul/0003.gif" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>
Q189_C3	Just to give you a brief Just to give you a brief idea about living costs in Qatar, take a good look at these facts:  1- Rent of a 1 bedroom apartment in a mid-class area is from 3,500 up to 4,500 QAR per month. Sharing an apartment with someone else may save you around 1,000-1,500 QAR per month.  2- Renting a small car (1500 cc) is around 1,500-1,700 QAR per month.  3- Food costs for a single per month are around 800-1,500 QAR depending on what you eat and drink. The previous number increments if you drink alcohol.  4- Going out on weekends costs around 200-300 QAR depending on what you do (that's about 800-900 QAR per month).  5- Water and electricity bills are around 300 QAR per month. Any extra services like mobile and internet are at about 250 QAR each (that's another 500 QAR per month).  Need I continue...?! I don't think so.  ********************************* <b> <i> Obstacles are what you see when you set your eyes off the goal.

Q211_C1	RE: is it okay to ride mini bike in qatar? Drive safe your family is waiting for you.
Q211_C2	RE: is it okay to ride mini bike in qatar? I'd guess as with most countries you can drive them on private land (with the owner's permission). If you want to use it along Salwa Road and have a death wish - feel free! At the end of the day, we all see people on quad bikes with inadequate lights and no protection on the roads here at times, so why not a mini bike? Whether you get away with it will depend on your nationality! I trust you take out life and third party insurance before you start! Mini bikes on public roads in the UK set a bad example for the "real" motorcyclists so it won't be any different here. Your call...

Q296	Can I drive to Egypt without having Triptec from Qatar???? I want to drive my car to Egypt this summer, but every time I ask, i get (you must get Triptic From Qatar cars Club) or something like that. and it needs Qatarian Sponsor.  Is there any way to go there by car without this Qatarian Sponsor for the Triptic??? The car is installed on Commercial Bank. Do i need any thing more Than Saudi Transit Visa??? Please Help
Q296_C1	RE: Can I drive to Egypt without having Triptec from... Hi leaders23   Impressive to read that you have done this journey twice, would it be possible for you to share your experience (short trip report) with us?  Thanks MandM
Q296_C2	RE: Can I drive to Egypt without having Triptec from... Hi leaders23   Impressive to read that you have done this journey twice, would it be possible for you to share your experience (short trip report) with us?  Thanks MandM
Q296_C3	RE: Can I drive to Egypt without having Triptec from... I read this thread while researching the Triptic requirements for my drive from Doha to London. Now that I am back in London I think I can dispel some of the myths.  I drove from Doha through Saudi, Jordan, Syria, Turkey, Greece, Italy, Germany and Holland before taking a ferry to the UK. The car had a Qatari number plate. Saudi first, You do not need a Triptic, just a visa (Transit in my case) which is usually valid for 3 days. There is nowhere to buy a Triptic anywhere near the Jordan border.   Jordan, There is no need for a Triptic or advance visa. This can be bought at the border along with car insurance.  Syria, There is no need for a Triptic. I had a visa from the Syrian Embassy in Doha. Insurance can be bought at the border.  Turkey, There is no need for a Triptic. Visa can be bought at the border along with car insurance.  Greece, no Triptic requirement, Insurance can be bought at the border and covers the whole EU for one month.  Having entered the EU, there are no further visa, insurance or Triptic requirements.  Egypt has a Triptic requirement but is a nightmare to drive in. I would recommend leaving the car in Aqaba and taking the ferry to Nuweiba, where coaches operate to Cairo.
Q296_C4	RE: Can I drive to Egypt without having Triptec from... thanks but i think i will not go to Jordan to go to Egypt I think from Saudi to Red Sea To Egypt (((I Think))!!! Does Any one know If it is the same like Jordan in Egypt (Safage)
Q296_C5	RE: Can I drive to Egypt without having Triptec from... You must have a tripticket, which is required by the Egyptian law. You also must have a passing visa through saudi arabia. And great amount of coffee to alert you while driving; and great patient on the borders. Have a safe trip
Q296_C6	RE: Can I drive to Egypt without having Triptec from... thanks Whatever-7 and Mohammed 1000 But Can i get this tripticket from the borders in Egypt or it is a must to get from Qatar??? If it was from Egyption borders then what is requisted for it????
Q296_C7	RE: Can I drive to Egypt without having Triptec from... Hi, look if you want to go to egypt by car you need to do triptek from here since your car has a qatari plate number. I went to lebanon twice, first I went without a triptek but it was a lot of headache especially at Syria borders, since I needed to pay twice on the borders. One when I entered and pass to lebanon and another time when I left lebanon coming back to Qatar through syria borders. I advise you to do a triptek but you need a qatari guy to sponsor you...Enjoy your trip :)
Q296_C8	RE: Can I drive to Egypt without having Triptec from... Hi Friend  Hope u will have a safe trip to Egypt. Yes, u need to get a trip ticket book from Qatar riving club in c ring road with a Qatari sponsorship.  For ur car is still under installment, no problem to leave Qatar but don't ask the bank to give u a letter to leave Qatar with ur car.  Also, u must have a valid Qatari license and u must make car insurance in the Saudi border and it will cost u 75/00 Saudi riyals per trip.   u have two ways to reach Egypt. 1a- thru Deba to hurghada by a high speed fairy boat and the trip will last for 4 hours approx.  1b- Thru Deba to Safaga and it will take about 12hours and I dont prefer it.  2- Thru Jordan from Al Aqaba to Sharm el Sheikh and the trip will take about 6 Hours by sea.  I hope that the above information is useful to u and it will help u to take the right direction.
Q296_C9	RE: Can I drive to Egypt without having Triptec from... So i cant get triptic from egyption border???? This is too sad coz i dont know any Qatari man over here!!! But is it the only way??????

Q381	Need Expert Advice I have an impt question and need expert feedback.  If the last day of annual leave is immediately followed by 3 days of Eid holidays, Are these 3 days considered as part of annual leave?   In my company the HR Dept. calculates the 3 days as extension of annual leave and hence leave without pay.  Is this correct as per the law?  Experts pls guide.

Q381_C2	No Way.. Dont keep quiet. No Way.. Dont keep quiet. How can Eid holidays be Leave without Pay? Gift a copy of Qatar Labour Law to your HR department. If they still persist to cut your salary go and see the Labour Department officials...thy will help you.
Q381_C3	some people going vacation some people going vacation this September, trying to negotiate with the company to extend 3 days from their planned vacation. for example they were supposed to start vacation by Sept 10 and comeback by Oct. 10 (1 month vacation) and the eid holidays will be from 21-24, they usually come back by Oct. 13. something like that.
Q381_C4	Labour law : Article (78) The worker shall be entitled to annually,   leave with full wage as   follows:  1.Three working days for Eid EI-Fitr 2.Three working days for Eid Al-Adha 3.One working day for the Independence day 4. Three working days to be specified by the employer.
Q381_C5	Not all companies fall under Not all companies fall under the labour law troll, you work in the ministry you should know that.   QP, RasGas, Al Jazeera etc and the rest of the government are not governed by the labour law, they are governed by their own policy with civil law be the deciding factor.   If you are on leave during a holiday, that day is counted as your annual leave. If you return from leave and resume work for one day prior to the Eid holiday then it will not be counted as annual leave. Same goes for maternity leave. Annual leave is paid leave and an public holidays that fall within it are not counted as extra days unless your company has specific policy in this regard.   ____________________________________________________ "Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"

Q476	should the landlord also be living in the flat he is subletting to others? i am renting a room in a shared 4 bedroom flat. the person who signed the contract for the flat does not live with us (only comes at month end to collect rent payments). is this legal in qatar rent law?
Q476_C1	RE: should the landlord also be living in the flat he is... Almost all rent contracts include a no-subletting clause.... So he won't be able to do it.
Q476_C2	RE: should the landlord also be living in the flat he is... Bleu; Most properties are actual sublets by agents, if you read my answer again, you will understand what I am talking about, as long as the sublet is done legally meaning with a contract between the Agent/Landlord and the tennant it is legal. Subletting doesn't only mean renting out a property that was rented from an agent without a contract. these are facts.

Is it true that there's a penalty? How much per day?
Q501_C1	RE: How much is the penalty per day for not stamping the RP? I think u get a minimum of 28 days, before a fine is imposed.. but then again, it depends on visa to visa...!! Is it a valid RP visa ... or a visiting visa?

Q543	Crossing red and getting back Yeserday I crossed a red ,was able to stop and reverse to the white line before the signal . Any chance I will  save the 6K riyals? .Didnt actually have the presence of mind to look out for the flash. I  actually lost my concentration because an emergency vehicle with flashing lights on top veered to the "left only" lane and got back into the straight lane and I like a dumb bloke looked at him instead of looking at the signal
Q543_C1	RE: Crossing red and getting back That happened with me,they did not charge even the flash lighted. the cameras record vedio as well so they will see that you did not cross the light. Regards.
Q543_C2	RE: Crossing red and getting back I heard there is video recording at signals so if they think you are good enough they might not charge you, but you can never say. Incase it comes then try to talk with them asap and you might get lucky.
Q543_C3	RE: Crossing red and getting back Hi Thanks everyone In the few months that I have been here I found the driving to be very stressful- more than in Saudi or Bahrain where I lived before.The other day I saw a woman driving a Lincoln SUV as though trying to reach her house on fire. Still wondering how such people can have a Driving licence with such tough laws around . regards and a have a good day!

Q545	Alcohol at the Pearl Am I correct in thinking that none of the restaurants at the Pearl are allowed to sell alchol anymore?
Q545_C1	Oh My Dayz! When will you ppl Oh My Dayz! When will you ppl stop ranting and raving and crying to heavens above for the suspicion of booze in Qatar? This is totally ridiculous!! Well just for the records, Alcohol sales has been suspended only at the Pearl....that's just one focking tiny area of the fockin city of Doha aight?.  Other outlets and hotels and still got it on their menu, besides if you just care to walk in to QDC Im sure you can notice the availability of liquor at these stores.   I'm getting very pissed off about the situation here, in the sense that so many expats are just outraged that this one section of the city has had sales suspended!! So they run to Ql to bit-ch about it, as tho if without alcohol, the world would crumbles tomorrow. !!! PFFFF Give it a fockin rest.  If you need booze that bad, you have a problem.! And if living in another culture is so difficult because you may not be able to drink, then you might want to consider just going home to your comfort zone.
Q545_C2	CAlm down DC, wait 'til they are sober, they won't understand you!  Lol!  BTW, it's suspension, not suspicion!  Lol! no offense, DC! Hehehehehh!
Q545_C3	sunday is a working day here sunday is a working day here :)
Q545_C4	Not even a day as member, the OP doesn't understand the issue!  Let's wait for another "newbee" to open up a bottle, errr I mean another alcohol-related question!  Lol!
Q545_C5	Flor1212 if it's just Flor1212 if it's just "another newbie alchol-related question" why are you bothering to post, thank goodness for pros like you who know how to answer questions on forums correctly... oh no wait.. ;)
Q545_C6	Only Suspended... Yup...Alchohol was only 'suspended' from sales on the Pearl (not officially banned). Give them around 5 more months and it will return back to full Alchohol sales. This ban reminds me of a 1998 ban on women smoking 'Shisha' (Hookah Pipes). It was later lifted. Its kind of Qatars way to calm the religious left when they have an incident. I would of thought maybe a religious mans kid came back home drunk and filed a complaint or something? Just a guess.
Q545_C7	/-a-t-/ OP...you are not in @ OP...you are not in Doha and so out of the loop but still can call a shame for the ban. BTW how did you get thinking that Pearl banned alcohol.  And just two words "Pearl Alcohol" returned me the two latest threads on the issue and I think irrespective of whether  you are in Doha or not if you can access QL you can run the search on it too... lazy people....:((  http://www.qatarliving.com/node/2364470 http://www.qatarliving.com/node/2440403
Q545_C8	A suspension that will A suspension that will eventually be lifted when sales are down at the restaurants, which all have Qatari investors who won't want to watch their profits dwindle.
Q545_C9	did you even care to read did you even care to read those threads Bachus?
Q545_C10	United Development Company United Development Company (UDC), the developer of The Pearl-Qatar, issued a statement announcing the resignation of Khalil Sholy, its managing director and president, on Thusrday, Reuters reports.  http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/12/idUSL6E8CC3BV20120112
Q545_C11	An interesting article http://m.arabianbusiness.com/qatar-alcohol-ban-could-be-tip-of-iceberg-for-gcc-440454.html Qatars move to ban the sale of alcohol on its flagship Pearl development may hint at the start of a Gulf-wide clampdown on booze sales as governments look to pacify local fears, analysts said.  The GCC states may move to rein in sales and tighten alcohol legislation in a bid to walk the line between the expatriate population and their Muslim citizens in the wake of the Arab Spring unrest, said Guy Wilkinson, managing partner at Dubai hospitality consultancy, Viability.  Qatar is hardly the first Gulf state in which the local population has expressed its concerns over the sale of alcohol, he told Arabian Business. Following the Arab Spring, I expect Muslim parties to have more and more influence over the control of alcohol throughout the region.  The sale of alcohol is strictly monitored in five of the Gulf states with Saudi Arabia operating an outright ban on the sale and consumption of liquor.  The move to offer alcohol licenses to outlets and non-Muslims is largely a nod to the regions expatriate workers, who vastly outnumber the local population. But the decision has been met with criticism from some citizens who oppose the sale of liquor in Muslim countries.  Qatar retains comparatively tight rules governing alcohol consumption, said Wilkinson.  Just a few years back, one could only find it in just a few luxury hotels and clubs with strict entry procedures, he said. The fact that its population has increased so fast over the last few years has evidently not changed the concerns of Muslims over the potential ill effects of alcohol consumption, particularly in terms of moral behaviour.  Chiheb Ben Mahmoud, head of Hotel Advisory, for MENA at Jones Lang LaSalle, said the open sale of alcohol was always a delicate balance for Gulf governments.  Sometimes, local public opinion is heated up on the back of a combination of factors. It is common for authorities in these cases to act swiftly in order to defuse tension and prevent the issue from heating up further and getting out of control, he said.  The suspension of sales on the Pearl could be seen as a wake-up call or a reminder of the invisible red lines not to be crossed.
Q545_C12	many thinks it's their rights, when it's already a compromise between the host and the visitors.   And surely, the noisy one will keep blah blah blah! It's just a choice between "more money less booze OR less money more booze"!  Lol! In Saudi, it's "more money and illegal booze", and the expats survive there!

Q562_C2	Well pitstop I don't mean to Well pitstop I don't mean to offend you or the chef. I am sure there has to be more then one person working on the sushi. Maybe I just got the wrong one.   Novita I will try la cigele's. And curious if anyone has tried sakura's yet at the ramada?   Please pass the number of your friend.
Q562_C3	PITSTOP I dont think sth is wrong with Japanese As I mentioned above maybe I was expecting sth different. All I know about Japanese culture was from movies. And if you do not try to make a lil search and try to know about a new culture -like me-, you can feel disappointment sometimes. For example I am feeling admire for Japanese people because they are almost the leader of Robotic technology, and for electronics they are also on the tops. But sometimes when I experience that it is very hard for some people to understand sth simple you are disappointed. In any case I admire Japanese people because they could build a strong and developed country after such a massive destruction at WWII while keeping their own traditions. And if we return to our original theme I love Sushi too. Am glad that they are so good at it ;)
Q562_C4	Default Nick: Don't worry Default Nick: Don't worry about it. We are all not how we expect ourselves to be. I hope that made sense.

Q612	Should traffic violations be settled before travelling on vacation? Should traffic violations be settled before travelling on vacation?
Q612_C1	RE: Should traffic violations be settled before... yes ! they will not let you out of the country before you paying the fines.
Q612_C2	RE: Should traffic violations be settled before... Yes, else you will be barred from leaving the country
Q612_C3	RE: Should traffic violations be settled before... I always settled traffic violations during registration and never had problem leaving country being frequent flyer...How?
Q612_C4	RE: Should traffic violations be settled before... You will only have to pay the violations before travelling if the fines are registered to your Qatar ID. So for a speeding fine that a radar caught you doing will be registered to the vehicle and not your ID in which case you will be fine. If you got stopped at a roundabout for not wearing a seatbelt and the police man asked for your license, then the fine would regisetred against your ID, in which case you would have to pay the fine before travelling.
Q612_C5	RE: Should traffic violations be settled before... it is only mandatory if you resigned and leaving qatar for good... but for frequent flyer not necessary.
Q612_C6	RE: Should traffic violations be settled before... Qatars Department of Traffic and Patrol Police has said motorists who have outstanding fines will not be allowed to leave the country once a new law comes into force this week, reported the Peninsula. Potential violators can access the Ministry of Interiors website from October 2 to check for any possible fines. Meanwhile fines will increase at a rate of QR1 per day if they are not paid within 60 days. via: ameinfo

Q619	if i fail to use my exit visa - is there a penalty? i have an exit visa due to expire -if i cant travel is there a penalty?
Q619_C1	RE: if i fail to use my exit visa - is there a penalty? exit permit is valid for 1 week from issuance..
Q619_C2	RE: if i fail to use my exit visa - is there a penalty? There are two types of exit permit.  The type good for one use, which expires if not used and and unlimited exit permit which is good for one year.  You should ask for the unlimited kind, if your sponsor is amenable, which will avoid the hassle of having to get one each time you leave the country(there is also a fee charged for the unlimited type), but don't be surprised if your sponsor refuses.  There is no penalty for failing to use either type of exit permit.
Q619_C3	RE: if i fail to use my exit visa - is there a penalty? Definatley not a problem, but a very good question that may answer a lot of people that maybe in the same situation in the future
Q619_C4	RE: if i fail to use my exit visa - is there a penalty? a follow up question....is it possible to get again ur exit permit from your sponsor or still valid? how many days do exit permit valid?

Q667_C4	My ex- maid was having an affair when she was here, probably lots of them.. and her hubby was at home looking after the kids.

Q667_C24	harry, if you wouldn't harry, if you wouldn't consider that as unfaithfulness, then does that mean rajah should just put a poker face, and wait until he stops philandering or hop from one woman to another? stand up for yourself and your kids. you might lose respect for yourself. don't ever let that happen to you.
Q667_C25	blippy.. I think Harry was being flippant..  If Rajah Park is silly enough to ask such a question then He/ She deserves a flippant answer..  I prsonally think that this is a troll having fun at our expense.. There have been too many similar threads from so called Filipinas lately..

Q667_C37	to answer the question on - faithful - truthful, loyal, or true (to you).  As for relationships broken caused by being away w/ each other, only your guilt of conscience can help you realized that. It's a matter of choosing your own destiny.
Q667_C38	ram it doesn't matter if your wife tell you such. If you don't wanna have an affair, you just don't. Respect your wife as you respect yourself. Treathening is not the cure for cheating or lying or whatever!  "so wag kang nega! BIXOXA!!"
Q667_C39	FranElizabeth, just for FranElizabeth, just for curiosity sake, did you let her husband know ? I ask because I was in a similar situation. Only it was my friend/colleague. She used to have fun while her family/husabnd thought she was with me / busy in a business meeting. Whenever her husband called to inquire I had to lie (as she asked me to before leaving with her BF). I thought it was'nt my business to interfere in her private affair - but once her husband asked me directly if there is another man in her life and I had to lie. She is no more a friend but I carry a guilt because I know her husband really cared for her and looked after the kids in her absence.

Q667_C42	We have no right to judge people eh!!! Darling,   Unfaithful is just a word, nobody really give a important to it.men are men if they slept with other ladies it doesn't  mean he loves her or he is ready to give up his family hey!! come on.. if you only look on scientific side its so simple... men needs to ejaculate once or twice a month (if i'm right?)but,anyway, they have to for health reason how they do it, its up to them. for women we don't need because we menstrual period every month. and husband without his wife on his side is very difficult.the stress of everyday routine. sometimes you have to understand that men are not saint. as a wife you know your husband very well.  women working away from home like middle east are not looking for married man because of sex experience.. they are looking for "knight in a shining armor" shoulder to lean on. stable and good paying job,huge bank account one who can give them what they want.easy life.extra curricular activities for free.mostly no string attached. hey! its not the end of the world welcome to computer age.. you can do something productive than crying and feeling sorry for yourself you can twist everything its all up to you.cheers
Q667_C43	rajah just because he is here and you are there, is no reason to accept his unfaithfulness. Just like him, you are alone...have you cheated on him? My guess is no. You have to make the decision as to what you can live with and what you can't. Don't just take it because he's a man...be a woman and have respect enough for yourself and do what is right for you and children. When he returns, have him get tested for any and all sexually transmitted diseases before you let him back in the house because if he has them, so will you if you let him back in your bed.   If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous, he will not bite you; that is the main difference between a dog and man. -Mark Twain-
Q667_C44	whoa liliachalmers... Men don't HAVE to ejaculate each month!! Who in the world fed you that line of BS???!!! There is no health reason for this "need".  Men and women's sex drives are basically the same..its how its dealt with that's different. You are giving the male the excuse to go find someone to have sex with because he "needs" to??? Get real!!  There is no biological requirement for that. And even if there was, they can always give THEMSELVES a helping hand..they don't have to go looking for a woman to have an affair with. Geez...get real..  If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous, he will not bite you; that is the main difference between a dog and man. -Mark Twain-
Q667_C45	rajah it depends on HOW you rajah it depends on HOW you found out!, is it thru your own knowledge, or just a message from your friend, or your relatives gave you that information.  sometimes it is very deceiving when things came up into our minds. Here is a classic sample..  The Boss and the Secretary.. One day the two of them drove to the Hotel, someone saw them while entering into the hotel, after an hour, the two left the Hotel. This witness spread the news that the two have an affair, they went to the hotel to release their desire. (Take note the witness wasn't sure what really happen inside the hotel)  The truth is, The Boss and the Secretary went to the Hotel to talk to the Manager of how they can promote their company with the help of the Hotel.  for the meantime just trust your husband.. he maybe unfaithful as what they say but still he is your husband and the father to your kids.  <a href="http://cgi.godsview.com/cgi-bin/rcdenig/pdchap.pl?file=3753&occ=27">RACHE ist Bergwerk saith der Lord</a>

Once he comes back home, show him how faithfull you've been opposed to what he has done, if this wont make him realize his mistake and rectified his misdoings, then by all means -dejar que se vaya, termine!  -easier said than done eh? yes it is but if worst comes to worst - why settle to an UNFAITHFULL husband when you deserve much better, i dont mean u get even with him by doing *** let him realize what a LOSER he is for messing up ur family...!!

Q673	Gatorade for kids? My kids (2 yrs and 9 yrs)  loves to drink Gatorade, i know gatorade is an energy drink (for rehydration) mostly for athletes... Its is safe for their age.??
Q673_C1	RE: Gatorade for kids? Energy drinks are often mixed with alcohol. Where energy drinks are stimulants, alcohol is a depressant. The mix can be particularly hazardous as energy drinks can mask the influence of alcohol and a person can fail to take its effects into consideration.[21] Normally fatigue would set in as large amounts of alcohol are being consumed, but the stimulating effect of energy drinks can override this effect.[22] Often drunk with vodka or in shots it has lead to increase in the purchase of pre-mixed drinks also known as alco-pops often containing guarana or taurine extract which provides energy drinks with their flavour.  avoid giving them ,make them to drink fruit juice.
Q673_C2	RE: Gatorade for kids? Hi Abno, thank you for your advice..Recently i read that information in Wikepedia..anyway thanks a lot.God Bless..
Q673_C3	RE: Gatorade for kids? what I give you now is not a Wikepedia cut & paste.  Most of the Energy drinks consists of Stimulants , some of which are used as "doping" by the athletes.  Initially the drink may give you sudden outburst of energy, but studies showed that such stimulants weakens the nervous system in the long run.
Q673_C4	RE: Gatorade for kids? Gatorade does not have alcohol and is not considered an "energy" drink such as Red Bull. Gatorade helps to replenish electrolytes and carbohydrates that are lost when participating in physical activities. It is also a good drink to have when you have been ill to your stomach.

Q693_C18	The sole IKEA Agent in the The sole IKEA Agent in the middle East is Al-Futaim. The reason Al futaim have failed to open a branch here is purely due to logistics. Unlike other furniture stores   in Qatar, IKEA has a policy of  accumulating all its items in one store( no backup stores in Industrial Area). Thus, Municipality never granted them approval for a Doha store.

Ikea is ok in India and othe Asian countries but it failed to perform in Singapore because the quality they give is 90% from China cheap rubber wood.If they will give anything duplicate in Qatar the ban they will get forever.Where in Middleeast the quality norms are high or even in world Ikea tries to save it skin from there...Trust me..They cant fool Qatar people so that is  why they are refraining themselves coming here...

Q757	Bring Great dane? Hi everyone.  I have been in Doha for 5 months, but had to go home. Now I am wanting to come back, but I would like to bring my dog with me. It is a Great Dane.. am I even allowed to bring him?
Q757_C1	maybe you can bring this cute maybe you can bring this cute one. i have seen many here. you just have to comply on some requirements of bringing one here, get some permit and you should have  with you his/her birth certificate.
Q757_C2	:) yes he is adorable Would you happen to know which requirements I need to comply? And which permit I need to get?
Q757_C3	Heleneg Contact Qatar Pet Travel....they have a good website and will let you know all the details
Q757_C4	I think you don't have I think you don't have permission to bring big pet..so for kind information you should contact Qatar Pet Travel.    http://www.amirafoods.com/
Q757_C5	heleneg Great Danes are not banned in Qatar and big dogs have always been allowed into Qatar. Whoever you are getting your info from is feeding you false information.  Please go to www.qatarpetrelocators.com for info and mail contact@qatarpetrelocators.com for assistance with brining your animal.  Doha is not a bad place for pets. Its the same the world over. Just because Qatar is a small country, it seems like we are over run with animals.  Just remember that when taking your pet from Qatar - Europe (if thats where you go to next) requires added documentation.
Q757_C6	Yes, just try contact Qatar Yes, just try contact Qatar pet travel. i understand your desire of bringing your Dane with you. my daughter like your age is also keeping another kind, so adorable and sweet. Try search of possibilities of bringing her in.
Q757_C7	Seriously? Up to last year big dogs were not allowed.. but things are obviously changing... As Oryx suggested, contact Qatar Pet Travel.
Q757_C8	Thank you all for answers :) I was actualy considering to drive to Qatar with the dog. It will be a lot cheaper and it will be an amazing experience! I just thought that the great dane might have been on the 'ban-list' in Qatar? But I will try to contact the pet travel company to hear their say
Q757_C9	How would you drive here? How would you drive here?  You, as a female, are not allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia. I don't know where you're coming from but if, for example, you're coming from UAE - you would need the proper documents issued by the UAE authorities/vets, probably documents allowing you to import/transit an animal via Saudi (if a man is doing the driving and if you are married to him, his sister, or his daughter or his mother) and then more docs to allow the dog to enter Qatar.  If you're coming from further afield and have more countries to pass through, it gets even more complicated on the document side.  I suspect nearly all of these countries would require a vet inspection by their vet before allowing the dog entry/transit through their country
Q757_C10	I will be coming from Denmark And I will of course make sure that the dog is fully vaccinated and have all it's documents in order - and that goes for every country we will transit. Also, I would have my stepfather come and pick me up in Saudi, as women are not allowed to drive there.  When I was last in Doha, I was told that bringing a Great Dane was illegal and impossible, but now I see that they are only restricted, so I guess I have all my questions answered.   Luckily my family lives in a big house with a nice garden with the lagoona in the backyard, so apart from the heat, the dog wouldn't get it any better. :)
Q757_C11	Saudi may not recognize your Saudi may not recognize your step father as your step father.  You should check that out before making any firm plans.
Q757_C12	Oh.. Maybe you are right. He Oh.. Maybe you are right. He is also my sponsor in Qatar - do you think that would be enough?

Q773	Are small dogs allowed on Parks? Hello there. Are small dogs allowed on Parks in Doha?
Q773_C1	RE: Are small dogs allowed on Parks? Probably best not. Some locals take offence and call the police.
Q773_C2	RE: Are small dogs allowed on Parks? I agree with the above comment. I took my dog at the corniche some time ago. Not so good reactions from some conservatives.However, some locals and their children loved playing with him. =)  Anyhow,I ended carrying him just to avoid any negative comments/complaints from the crowd there

Q803	Is Cipralex a controlled drug in Qatar? Is Cipralex a controlled drug in Qatar? Can this be brought from outside the country? Will there be checking for this at the Doha Airport when you arrive from outside?
Q803_C1	RE: Is Cipralex a controlled drug in Qatar? They sell all of those group of drugs in the pharmacy, some you will need a local prescription for (available from a primary health doctor or specialist) but usually just buy over the counter. You are required to carry a medical certificate or copy of prescription when entering Qatar in case you get checked but as long as you are just taking the medication for yourself and not trying to import it for others you will be ok. Receiving medications of any kind by post is an absolute no. It is illegal and anything medicinal will be kept by customs (including a face mask I ordered from Elemis but I did get it back.)
Q803_C2	RE: Is Cipralex a controlled drug in Qatar? You'll need a prescription for it. You can bring it in but make sure you have a note from your doctor saying that he prescribed it for you

Q820	Are U.S. College Degrees Valuable in Qatar ? Hi Forum,  I'm currently a student in America,  completing my Bachelor's degree in Business Administration (Management Information Systems) from an accredited U.S. College.  I heard that degrees from American or British colleges are very valuable in Qatar,  is this true ?  I will also pick up experience before applying for a job in Doha.  Please kindly let me know,  thanks.

Q820_C2	well said edifis well said edifis :)  ex.ex.expat,That is why I said it depends on how one spend :) cheers.
Q820_C3	ex ex Yes he is American, but he has Asian roots and if you know your land well, you will know that the Asians over in the West are know for having a "savings account". So maybe he does not lead the "extravagant" lifestyle your family leads and $2000 may suffice for him for starters.  IMHO, depending on where he worked, yes he could get more than $2000 in the US, but the problem over there is there is more supply than demand for the type of work he is looking for.
Q820_C4	There is no harm in trying You  SHOULD put your ideas in action rather that talkingjust go to   http://www.qf.org.qa/output/page19.asp   http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/index.asp?cu_no=2&temp_type=44   There is no harm in trying
Q820_C5	Vegas Unfortunately there are a lot many job seekers who will come here for $2K/ month. Many of the Asians see this as a stepping-stone for better prospects. Besides, $2K for an Asian is a lotta money.
Q820_C6	Not for an Asian American Colt You seem to forget the chap says he is American. Why would he come here for such a low salary? As a stepping stone to $2500/month? Another low salary. This is very low by American standards from what I know.
Q820_C7	Yes, he's just starting off and he hasn't even got a degree Wouldn't it be better to tell him the truth and encourage him to get a degree, rather than chase  low salary half-way around the world to a place that is more expensive than where he is?
Q820_C8	ex ex I never told him to come 7000miles across here chasing a low-salaried job. I was the one to tell him the pay will not be more than $2K approx.
Q820_C9	Btw ex ex whatever made you think he's not getting a degree?
Q820_C10	His other thread colt. He wanted to come here for a job at one of the universities he didn't get, said he didn't have a degree and inquired about whether it was necessary.
Q820_C11	Doc we're not fighting, we're debating :-P...   Btw, he has clearly mentioned in the post that he's completing his Bachelor's degree in Business Administration (Management Information Systems) from an accredited U.S. College.   Regarding his job, he said he almost got an IT related help-desk job at Carnegie Mellon. I don't know what happened to that one though :-(
Q820_C12	teksource84 Well, that's great that you have it planned out...  If I come across any help desk job that pays that range, I'll let you know!
Q820_C13	Hmm, not to be negative here Hmm, not to be negative here but a young person just starting out with a newly minted degree may not have that much success here in the Gulf. Just my observation. Mandi
Q820_C14	Epi Rishi is correct on that one... and that is what I have observed a lot in the Gulf... A EU/ UK/ US/ AU etc. passport will get you a better position with a better payscale in most companies in Doha.  Another observation I made here is that, to be a secretary, you don't need short-hand, nor do you need typing skills (min words/ min etc.) As long as you're under your husbands sonsorship, you can get a secretarial job.
Q820_C15	This is gonna turn into the This is gonna turn into the typical 'why do westerners earn more' bashing topic which has been discussed a million times...
Q820_C16	Mandi In an earlier thread he mentioned that he almost got an IT related help-desk job at Carnegie Mellon... idk what his deal is???

Q947	Will pregnancy affect employment offer My friend's wife will receive a job offer from a government office in another 4 -5 days.Today they came to know that the lady is 1 month pregnant.Will this affect her employment offer and what about the medicals prior to joining job too.

Q947_C4	I think its not a problem, I think its not a problem, but she will not be elgible for meternity leave before one yr...
Q947_C5	Normally pregnancy is not Normally pregnancy is not looked as a hindrance. Esp in the govt sector here in doha. But better to mention orally before the tests go through. Honesty never fails!
Q947_C6	Looking at it from an HR Looking at it from an HR point of view, she's not a good investment.  First of all she'll have to take quite a bit of time off in her first 9 months (for doctors appts. sick leave, etc) as well as 54 days of maternity leave, and the likely hood of her coming back to work is slim.    I wouldn't hire her.
Q947_C7	As per experience, yes it As per experience, yes it will surely affects her job offer. I am one of the recruitment officer in one of the govt offices before, and its one of the policy that they can't hire a pregnant women even in some govt & private offices that i've known. Their reasons: 1st, they will thought that you will be going to file your long day leave upon delivery or often to file a leave during pregnancy. 2nd, they will probably thought that you cannot exert ur best effort in doing your job because usually pregnant women feels so many body changes, body pains etc, and sometimes some superior are hesitant to give work load to their staff if she is pregnant. 3rd: ur medical results will be stamped as UNFIT to work if found out that your pregnant... So the best thing, if your planning to look for work, dont get pregnant, but you can get pregnant if you already hired or started to work (bec. that's 2 different case)...
Q947_C8	Even with the smiley face Even with the smiley face  that is harsh prism :-p, not true for many many pregnant women, but mm is right too. Anyway, even while being pregnant and hormonally on a roller coaster, pregnant women can be extremely active and bring good results on the work front.  Coming to the op, if the medical is already over, then nothing really to worry about, except probation may go longer, once they know the employee is pregnant. If medical is not complete yet, and if the candidate is really required by the company, then a temporary job offer may be presented to her, and only when she returns back from her maternity leave, will her job become permanent. It all depends upon their hr policies.
Q947_C9	Will pregnancy affect employment offer agreed with Arlene advised, its all country ruling not to hire pregnant unless nobodies qualified for the post in the country or the applicant is a scientest.
Q947_C10	I wish her all the best, I wish her all the best,
Q947_C11	han19...I didnt mean to be han19...I didnt mean to be harsh... just stated reality from a corporates POV...for idiots I think there is no issue...for pregnant women coming on board afresh, other women have already elaborated on it....and smiley was just to soften the pinch of reality...:)   But still if it sounds harsh my apologies to whomever it may concern, as it was unintentional.
Q947_C12	If she receives a job offer If she receives a job offer letter and later gets turned away, then she may file a claim for discrimination. I don't know if that can go anywhere in this legal system.  But if she gets hired, her employer will have the right of putting her under unpaid leave, during the 50-day maternity leave period. For more details, read Art. 96 of the Labour Law (see below)  "A female worker who has been employed by an employer for a complete year shall be entitled to maternity leave with full pay for a period of fifty days. Such maternity leave shall include the period before and after the delivery provided that the period following the delivery shall not be less than thirty five days."
Q947_C13	2012 Olympics, I have worked 2012 Olympics, I have worked as a recruiter for over 14 years and I can witness how women can be far more productive during their pregnancy.
Q947_C14	Maybe they can.  But your Maybe they can.  But your view is not the view of most employers here.
Q947_C15	In my similar yrs of working In my similar yrs of working under, along side and in supervising capacity didnt see or hear anyone of them being as productive when they were not pregnant... the toughest ones were those who had the hobby of getting pregnant (every year)...finding someone to delegate for them used to be a big challenge for understandable reasons.
Q947_C16	Well, 2012 Olympics, the way Well, 2012 Olympics, the way you wrote your previous comment made it looked more like your own perspective AS an employer.  Testing an applicant for pregnancy is nothing but an act of discrimination. I cannot argue whether is legal or not in this country, but is just my humble opinion on this particular issue.  Prism, I know what you're talking about, but it's a matter of education and culture and companies would need to enforce a strict recruitment control, ensuring that all applicants go through proper channels and procedures. We all suffer the same not only from pregnant women but also from male slackers who will keep calling-in sick almost every sunday or thursday for no apparent reason.
Q947_C17	after the medical check-up after the medical check-up they will inform to the employer and it's the employer decision.  if the employer is ok with that, they have no problem to accept you and process your papers

Q1069_C4	thanks for that thanks hannah981
Q1069_C5	some people tell me right, some people tell me you can get sma in megamart but it wasnt there today- things are like that here - when they are they buy lots cos it may not be there again. In carrefour they had semilac, nestle, aptamil, pediasure ensure and wyeth. On the Sma website it links to wyeth- I dont know if they are made by the same company but apparently they are equivalent. If you google sma and the countries it is in it directs you to wyeth for some countries including qatar. These brands all seem to be readily available in the shops and were in a few different shops so should be easy to get hold of. If you research SMA maybe it is the same as the wyeth?? If your little one has to have sma and the link with wyeth goes nowhere then I would ship it but it'll be fairly expensive. I guess the only alternative is to try to switch to something else thast you can get here gradually before you come so you dont have a mare when you get here?  Wish you all the best with the move and the baby. My research is just testament to how bored I am as I have not yet found a job. I am also in healthcare and it seems hard for westerners to get those kind of jobs here!

Q1101	bank account status after leaving doha?? If you have a bank account in Qatar and later you move out from Doha, is it possible to keep the account active and make transactions online??
Q1101_C1	RE: bank account status after leaving doha?? Yes, baldrick2dogs is correct.  I asked them the same thing and received the same answer.
Q1101_C2	RE: bank account status after leaving doha?? I was been cancelled before then recently came back to Doha. After I inquired with my previous bank, they gave me the same bank account as my previous one. Same thing with Q-tel, I applied for new connection and still they asked me to pay my outstanding bill which is under my ID number (I did not pay before my arrears since it is just less than 300 QR). Therefore, they will not cancel your account even if your work visa is cancelled.
Q1101_C3	RE: bank account status after leaving doha?? They don't have time to update/ cancel the a/c's of left peoples coz..they are running with short of time to give proper in time service to the existing costomers.
Q1101_C4	RE: bank account status after leaving doha?? i agree with yoiu that they dont update the data.  but dont force me to beleive they give excellent service to exsitng customers.. it is a matter of technology how to be used. If yoiu go out of your country after visa cancellation without repaying the loan, how they catch you at airport ?.... so if they want to update data, they do it,

Q1106	Can I sell my car still under car loan from the bank I took car loan from the bank for 4 years. 3 years are already completed. Can I sell this car without informing the bank, because I am paying with check book every month they are taking my money from my bank. How about the change over process? Thanks for sharing
Q1106_C1	RE: Can I sell my car still under car loan from the bank Yes, you can sell your car. You have to take the buyer of your car to the bank and settle all your remaining amount in the bank plus pay you if the total price of the car beyond or higher than the remaining amount in the bank. After that process done, the bank will give out NOC to you for you to hand over the NOC to the new buyer for him to process with the traffic police department to change the ownership. You have to go along with the new buyer to the Insurance company to change the ownership before proceed to the traffic police department for changing the ownership and renewal of the registration card. Cheers..
Q1106_C2	RE: Can I sell my car still under car loan from the bank Dann is correct. You can either go to the registration dept first if the buyer feel un-secure and then go to the insurance company second.  But first you must go to the bank along with you buyer to clear the outstanding amount before proceeding.  If buyer has an account in the same bank, then bullseye! your task is much easier.
Q1106_C3	RE: Can I sell my car still under car loan from the bank If you look at the reverse (back) of your car registration card, at the right hand bottom you will see a column 'Type of Ownership' in Arabic NOUGH ALMUKIA. If you have your banks name written there, you can not sale this car without a no objection letter from the bank.

Q1230_C1	I hope it answers your query Flying With Your Pet FAQAir travel for animals can be tricky and dangerous business, so it is important to know what the law, the airlines, and veterinarians recommend. QuestionsHow do I know if air travel is appropriate for my pet? What steps should I take prior to a flight to make sure my pet's trip goes smoothly and safely?  Can my pet travel in the cabin of the airplane, rather than in the cargo hold?  What does the law require me to do if my pet is going to travel in the plane's cargo hold?  AnswerHow do I know if air travel is appropriate for my pet?Not all pets can or should travel by plane. Air travel is stressful for pets, so you should consider a number of factors before deciding to transport your pet on an airplane, including your pet's disposition, age, breed and health.  Heat or Pregnancy. Animals who are in heat or who are pregnant should not travel by plane.  Age. Federal law requires that animals be at least eight weeks old and fully weaned (meaning weaned for at least five days) before they travel in the cargo hold of a plane. Although the law does not say so, veterinarians generally recommend against putting elderly pets through the discomfort of air travel.  Breed. Pug-nosed animals should never travel in the cargo hold of a plane. This is because of the structure of their faces, which may inhibit their breathing during air travel. If your dog is of one of the breeds listed below, be sure to discuss the issue with your veterinarian and with the airline. Many airlines will not accept pug-nosed animals for air travel. The following dogs are considered to be pug-nosed:  American StaffordshireEnglish Toy SpanielDutch PugShih TzuStaffordshire Bull TerrierBrussels GriffinPekineseBoston TerrierEnglish BulldogJapanese Pug, andJapanese Spaniel.

Q1234_C2	RE: I got an job offer for 7000 qr without accomodation... this offer kind of OK if they provide u Family Accomodation.
Q1234_C3	RE: I got an job offer for 7000 qr without accomodation... You will spent minimum 3500Qr for your accomodation(partitioned villa 1BHK...managable space!!!), for 4 people you will have a grocery bill around 1500qr per month. then your childrens studies etc etc... if your company will give you family accomodation, transport its ok.. you can think about it!!

Q1234_C7	RE: I got an job offer for 7000 qr without accomodation... No way... The offer is not good for supporting a family... One fully furnished 1BHK flat will go not below QAR 5000/-... This offer could be still considerable if the company provides you with a family accomodation +QR 7000. Thats the most expensive thing here... Negotiate with the company or else wait for better opportunity...

Q1321	Is it true  that  Jordanians  now  are being banned from Qatar? Is it true  that  Jordanians  now  are being banned from Qatar, I want to know because I am a Jordanian and I  signed  a contract with governmental company in Qatar since September 2008 ( so  since 5 months ) and I contacted them several times and they keep saying : your visa  still under procedure, I beginning to lose hope, so is it true that there is no visas now for Jordanians?
Q1321_C1	RE: Is it true  that  Jordanians  now  are being banned... As long as i know, it is tru!, i'm also working in govt. sector (oil field), and we are not getting jordanian visas, even for business visit (14 days), we are submitting for special approval.
Q1321_C2	RE: Is it true  that  Jordanians  now  are being banned... Unfortunately, this is what all say.. and even employees from egypt... better to search in an other country... good luck
Q1321_C3	RE: Is it true  that  Jordanians  now  are being banned...

Q1321_C7	RE: Is it true  that  Jordanians  now  are being banned... what is the root cause?
Q1321_C8	RE: Is it true  that  Jordanians  now  are being banned... any issue related to this is mainly because of political issue or non cooperation between Qatar and the other country. in plus, they are banned because of the palestinians who have jordanian papers. there are too many here and the qatari goverment should make equilibrium between all nationalities! i advice u not to ask for Borrow visa or to shift ur visa. u ll be banned 100%.
Q1321_C9	RE: Is it true  that  Jordanians  now  are being banned... Yes its true dat Jordanians nationalities are now not getting visas, being in HR i  also tried for their visa but no use, they can reniew the old residence but there is no chance for getting new visa. Yallah bro best of luck, everything happens for good so dont loose hope Allah Mak..
Q1321_C10	RE: Is it true  that  Jordanians  now  are being banned... yes unfortunatly ....they reject my wife visa also since she is jordanian....even i satisfied all the conditions from ministry and rent home and every thing. i called jordanian embassy and they told me the same.

Q1347	Is there anybody living in the Pearl ? I saw many cars parked under UDC tower. Does anybody know if people start living in the pearl ?  As an apartment owner in the pearl, I fed up with the postponing of the handover date...
Q1347_C1	RE: Is there anybody living in the Pearl ? Why not contact UDC, if they are your developer, to get a clear picture (good or bad), rather than rely on others, who may or may not be well-informed and could be giving you accurate information or idle speculation?   I am also an investor in The Pearl, and have found, in all my dealings with UDC (ie the people at the Oyster), that they are very professional, helpful and transparent. They will tell you the situation as it stands now, progress and delays, because it is in their interests to ensure that investors have confidence in them and their project.   My apartment is in Viva Bahriya, so not due for completion yet. It is hard to wait, because once you've been down and seen for yourself the scope of the project, you just want to move in and enjoy sitting on your balcony overlooking the sea. Ignore the snipers, stay cool, it will be worth the wait!
Q1347_C2	RE: Is there anybody living in the Pearl ? I know it is hard to wait, especially given the current economic uncertainty, but none of us (including the developer and the banks) could have predicted what has happened, on a global scale, over the last few months, so we are all having to adjust to the new reality which we didnt foresee when we originally made the investment.  As any investment is about confidence, it doesn't make sense to 'talk down' the project, or encourage rumours about how awful the project is. If you look at other threads on this subject, you can see that those directly involved in the construction are all proud of it: only those unconnected but with 'inside knowledge' ( ie from friends of friends) are predicting doom.  Again, I suggest that you go down to the site and speak to the developer to get a clearer picture which will help you plan.
Q1347_C3	RE: Is there anybody living in the Pearl ? No one lives at the Pearl yet.   As there is no water or electricity services yet.  UDC and Kharamma are locked in a power struggle over costs and the poor buyers of flats are the losers.
Q1347_C4	RE: Is there anybody living in the Pearl ? Having followed up with UDC, I have learned that the issue with the power supply was in fact resolved almost 2 weeks ago and they expect people to be living in Porto Arabia by the end of May. Please don't take my word for this, (after all I could just be another one spreading rumors),check with them yourself to see how your property fits into the schedule. Hope it goes well for you!
Q1347_C5	RE: Is there anybody living in the Pearl ? I talked to UDC and they said their towers will be opened in May. Electricity and water problems are solved and ready for all porto arabia. I guess in the 4th Quarter of this year, most of the towers will be opened.  I was in Abu Dhabi at the weekend and stayed in one of my friends apartment. His apartment is having a magnificent sea view next to beach(like the apartment in the pearl). It gives me some idea how the life will be in the pearl; simply "dolce vita!!!". Most of the people living in Doha cannot imagine the life style in the pearl and when it will be completed, I am sure it will be one of the dream place to live in.   So, we waited a lot but I guess it will worth it!
Q1347_C6	RE: Is there anybody living in the Pearl ? Istavrit,  I was down there this week as well and totally amazed at the progress, especially with the shops (OK, just need the money to buy), cafes and landscaping. The waterfront is beautiful and the atmosphere unlike anywhere else in Doha, more reminiscent of Palm Beach or parts of Europe. The project is really moving on and taking shape.

Q1352	Any one expect the rent to go down ? I noticed during the last couple of weeks that the rental dropped a little bit , anyone have information abouth this , i mean look at all these empty compounds and buildings no one wil fill them if there is no resonable prices .

Q1392	Can films help change society ? Read an interesting article about the power of Film.  The premise is that movies can send a message to the audience and thus help change society.  An example given was "The Blind Side". I saw this film, loved it, but did it help me become a better person ? I don't know..  Recently, someone stated "People get their values from the silver screen."  Would you agree ?
Q1392_C1	since long time Americans are since long time Americans are getting inspiration from their Hollywood, look at Rambo type movies, perhaps they need another episode to capture Osama and Taliban's leader.
Q1392_C2	Yes I do think films have an effect on some a lotta people in society. I did like "The Blind Side", it is a beautiful film and I remember reading an article later about a few people being taken in by that movie and legally adopting afro-american kids like him.  Nomerci is right about the action flicks and well as the chick-flicks.   Rags to riches movies also do have an effect on the less fortunate who strive hard to complete their education and work harder to get noticed.

Q1392_C12	TheLucyShow.. I got confused, but what i think you're saying that Bollywood influences how people dress.  That's fair enough. But what about sending out a moral/ethical/religious message. Do Bollywood films help you perhaps become a better person ?

Q1392_C16	of course the mass of course the mass media/movie production can change society. But i wouldn't use word "help". "help" is something positive, while mass production can affect society very negatively. Movie can definitely form a certain images, pattern behavior, stereotypes, etc. All Film companies reduce the number of smoking scenes in their films, some of them have banned these scenes completely. Movie creates stereotypes that are followed by people. Girls want to look, to be dressed and to behave as their favorite actress. Guys want to act like their hero acts. This is normal  process. Brit, one separate movie might not help one individual become better (but also MIGHT help), but creating a whole image of certain behavior and stereotypes in the society definitely can make this society better (or worse)

Q1607_C3	Please judge based on evidence or personal experience It's that time of the year when new comers to Qatar begin exploring schools for their children.  Good luck with it all.  It is not an easy process.  But I think it would be more helpful if people spoke from personal experience and based on evidence.  Impressions and second hand information can be misleading. BTW, my kids go to Sherborne, and I am pleased with it.  I don't think it will be comparable to the Dorset school.  It can't be, and I don't judge it on that basis.  I judge it on the curriculum, staff, activities, interaction with parents, etc.  As for fees, while it is not cheap, it is less expensive than Compass, ASD, and ACS Doha.  I think DESS is subsidized, right?  Good luck with ACS and when you've gone through the experience, please write about it.  I am sure many people will want to know.

Q1607_C5	Dintovich...what do you mean Dintovich...what do you mean about "being honest"? I have nothing to hide whatsoever. And we are very happy with the school my children go to, I have no reason to consider change. But, if I were, then "rich kids" would certainly not be a deterrent for me. Although, except for  some Qatari children, i have not seen any rich kids here.
Q1607_C6	you are right kiwinyc. it you are right kiwinyc. it seems like Dintovitch does have a very large chip indeed which makes me suspicious about how genuine the comments are. perhaps the fees are too high for them, or their kids did not get in when they applied or they are they elsewhere and are worried about some of these new up and coming schools taking away students. might go and have a look at sherborne myself so there is your answer Dintovitch, my children are not at sherborne but i have heard many good things about it. now answer expatlady.
Q1607_C7	In a court of law the judge In a court of law the judge does not examine the motives of why a witness says this or that but looks at what has been said; is it or could it be true or false?  If we start on the road of why somebody says something or another we will end up nowhere. I could for example retort by asking why, you out there, are you trying to protect Sherborne-Qatar and I could go into theorizing about you perhaps being British and want to protect your national school or your kids are in that school and you want to justify your decision for taking them there or many large number of possible motives. If we go along this road there will be no end to the discussion.  Let us instead try to be rational and confine ourselves to facts and not to what is in the hearts and cannot be seen. It doesn't really matter whether I have a chip on my shoulder or not (you will never find out), what matters is; what I have said about Sherborne-Qatar, is it or could it be true or false? This is what we should look at. Also, when I say "spoilt rich kids" I don't mean they are spoilt because they are rich per se, no, those unfortunate kids are the kind that have been brought up mostly not by their parents but by the maids (not even trained nannies) who are in the palaces. And regarding this point the same will apply to ACS Doha.  Another point needs clearing; I did not say that Sherborne-Qatar is bad as teaching goes (but it could be bad for your kid because of the demographics.) I said that it will never be like Sherborne-UK because the raison d'etre for Sherborne-Qatar is different from that for Sherborne-UK. Sherborne-Qatar has shareholders who will siphon money away from it unlike Sherborne-UK.   Please also remember that Sherborne-UK is only a secondary boarding school which means Sherborne is new in the primary school field. Why did they start with primary school in Qatar? Is it because it is a bigger market?
Q1607_C8	Sherborne Prep in Dorset was Sherborne Prep in Dorset was established in 1858 for students from aged 3 - 13 years - therefore I think they have some primary school experience. It runs alongside Sherborne Boys and Sherborne Girls Senior Schools. They also have an international school in the UK which prepares overseas students for entry into their main schools. The schools are both day and boarding. There is a clear understanding and acceptance that Sherborne Qatar wishes to establish its own identity whilst keeping some of the values from the 'mother school.
Q1607_C9	If you google "Sherborne Prep If you google "Sherborne Prep in Dorset" you will find that it has nothing to do with the 560 years old Sherbone-UK. It just has the name Sherborne by virtue of being in Sherborne town. If you visit Sherborne-UK website you will find that the only link they have is Sherborne-Qatar. Also the schools' logos are different.  As for the International School that prepares overseas students for entry into the main Sherborne, I know nothing about and I don't know whether it even exists. If it does I am sure it is totally separate from the main Sherborne that we know. It could be a private school that has thought of exploiting the niche of preparing students to the main Sherborne.  So, I stand by what I said earlier that they have not managed a primary or a prep school before! I am not saying this makes then inadiquate, no, I don't know about that, but just that they were willing to undergo such an experience for the sake of financially supporting Sherborne-UK.  You will get just as good an education, if not better for your kids somewhere else, cheaper and without being hit by the demographics I mentioned earlier.
Q1607_C10	Wow.  I didn't realize. Wow.  I didn't realize.  Thanks for the post Dintovitch.
Q1607_C11	Not only that it will never Not only that it will never be the same as Sherborne in the UK because of the spoilt rich kids but also because here in Qatar Sherborne is for profit unlike its sister in the UK because a)they have a Qatari partner to whom they should pay dividends and b)part of the extra money they make goes to support the true Sherborne in the UK which is facing some financial difficulties; why do you think they are here in the first place!?   You are right AngelinaBallerina, Sherbornr-Qatar can never be as Sherborne-UK.     All in all I think Sherborne-Qatar will mar the name and the old academic tradition of Sherborne-UK.
Q1607_C12	Dintovich, I have children in Dintovich, I have children in school here. I have not seen many "spoilt, rich kids" that mar the reputation of our school.....what kind of people are you actually talking about???
Q1607_C13	Whatever next 'Oxford Whatever next 'Oxford University Qatar'?? Shrewsbury School Qatar?? Marlborough College Qatar......Nahhhh....
Q1607_C14	Look, all I @ nomerci  Look, all I am saying is that the raison d'etre for Sherborne-Qatar is not the same as that for Sherborne-UK for which you have taken your child in the first place. Sherborne-Qatar was originally founded in order to provide dividends for its founders and shareholders; the Qatari plus Shareborne-UK. Really there are better and cheaper schools with less pompous names such as DESS that was founded just for the benefit of the students who study in it and no one else. But unfortunately many prefer to brag about their kid who is studying at Sherborne-Qatar.
Q1607_C15	Hey nomerci, where were your Hey nomerci, where were your children before you took them to Sherborne-Qatar?
Q1607_C16	Dinovitch, ok, I have no idea Dinovitch, ok, I have no idea about that school, so I take your word for it. Although, I know of a few parents and students who seem to like the school.
Q1607_C17	Thank you nomerci for being Thank you nomerci for being honest! Good luck to your children wherever they are but don't take them there!
Q1607_C18	Where do your children go to Where do your children go to school Dintovitch
Q1607_C19	They are well-established in They are well-established in the UK - you can see their website here http://www.acs-schools.com/acs-doha.aspx  I have toured the campus and have to say it's quite impressive.  My son is at Compass, which I am quite happy with, but you won't go wrong with ACS-Doha either.  Here's some info from their website:  The Programme  Initially we will be offering our prestigious Early Years, Lower School, and Middle School curriculums, based on globally recognised American and international standards, with an aim to deliver the same range of academic programmes successfully offered at our three UK campuses [learn more]. As the campus develops a High School we will also seek authorisation to offer prestigious US College Board Advanced Placement (AP) courses. ACS Doha will also offer an American High School Honours Diploma. The school will shortly be a member of the Council of International Schools.  The Doha campus offers a rigorous academic curriculum of English, mathematics, science, humanities, world languages, and fine arts. Our programme challenges students to become independent, reflective, inquiring, and knowledgeable; confident communicators who are principled, open-minded and caring; socially and emotionally intelligent and able to embrace the importance of a healthy and balanced lifestyle.
Q1607_C20	Be careful, it is one where Be careful, it is one where spoiled rich children with bad habits and manners conglomerate. Because it is so overpriced and because of its location it would attract mostly these types. Remember; your child will learn more from his peers than from his teachers.  There are still many good schools where your child will much happier. Take Sherborne which is a very good school in the UK I hear but here in Qatar it is suffering from the same problem I mentined above!
Q1607_C21	well my children are not well my children are not spoilt, dont have bad manners, havent any bad habits you would worry about and we are not rich - neither are their friends of which they have many. For you information children learn first and foremost from their parents and taking into consideration your highly critical letter I am trying to picture your children, if you have any of course. If parents bring up their children well enough, they will not be affected so much by negative peer pressure whatever school they are in.
Q1607_C22	Where are Hello d-esertmum  Where are your kids? How can you be not rich and have your kids attend one of these schools? And if the company is paying the fees then your salary must be quite high. ACS Doha has not started yet anyway, so do your kids go to Sherborne? Hope to hear from you because I disagree that kids don't learn much from their peers; peer pressure is a strong force!

There will also be free beer, subsidized pork sausages, an early Christmas every year, no road accidents in Doha and no school fees.   Why don't you grow up, Pilo_111?

Q1677	buying S VOLVO car hi friends i am intending to buy a second handed volvo car of S80,2004 within my range but worried about the maintenance and other expenses which may rise in future that would drain out my pocket.can anyone  share their experience of using the same car and also your opinions about that car of second handed type.
Q1677_C1	RE: buying S VOLVO car Never think about it, maintinance cost is very high and the resell value is very low.
Q1677_C2	RE: buying S VOLVO car Ask previous Volvo owners. If you ask the vast majority of Qatar Living members that will drive nothing but Japanese cars then you won't get an honest answer.   Also please do remember that you are buying a prestige brand so the cost of maintaining that will be more than a cheap, volume brand. When it comes to customer service at Volvo service centres, please just try them once. They are professional, courteous and most of all honest.   If you would like any information or history on the car you are buying please do not hesitate to contact me on 6022476. I work for DOMASCO Volvo and we DO VALUE ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS!
Q1677_C3	RE: buying S VOLVO car I've been using Volvos for about 5 years now both in Qatar and in the UK and they have proven to be very reliable cars. The cost of maintenance is slightly higher than most but then you are getting what you pay for.  Regarding the comment about cars falling apart after 5 years, I think that person was talking about American cars.
Q1677_C4	RE: buying S VOLVO car I agree with Joe90. The S80 a great car. Here in North America both Volvo and Honda are considered great cars (and Toyota) that offer great value and great service from dealers. It's disappointing to hear the dealers of these cars n Qatar doesn't hold up their end of the bargain.  You'd hardly need to worry about a Volvo breaking down. When it does, yes, parts are a bit more expensive than Japanese cars but nowhere near the level of Mercedes or BMW. It's comfortable and safe, huge trunk, sporty feel. You could feel the heavy weight of the car when you first start driving it, which is why it uses as much gas as it does. I love mine but sadly have to sell it soon when I move to Doha.  So, that's why relatively, I see less Hondas on sale on this site than Toyotas. The dealership. I was wondering why I don't see the Honda Ridgeline and Pilot listed anywhere, nor the Toyota Sienna. Honda's mystery solved.

Q1702_C2	RE: Do I need to take medical exam before entering Doha? after arrival at doha , u can do medical test for visa extn.........before no use to do medical.
Q1702_C3	RE: Do I need to take medical exam before entering Doha? You dont need a medical for a one week visit. A medical is required if you are going to apply for residence or a long term visit visa. Then you need a medical and it must be done here in Doha
Q1702_C4	RE: Do I need to take medical exam before entering Doha? Medical tests are mandatorily required for people coming here to stay for 6 months and more. These are basic tests only.  You can go for a complete health check-up if something about your health bothers you.
Q1702_C5	RE: Do I need to take medical exam before entering Doha? there is no need for a medical before entering doha for a visit..

Q1831_C1	RE: is it possible to enter doha airport with out a... No you cannot enter, but you can avail the services of Al Maha meet and greet services who can do that all for you.
Q1831_C2	RE: is it possible to enter doha airport with out a... Al Maha is good, however you need to provide them with the details at least 48 hours before their arrival time and i think its about 600qr for 2 ppl but im not sure. just call qatar airways and ask the exact details.

Q1831_C6	RE: is it possible to enter doha airport with out a... Marycatherine,  Perhaps , you meant Al Maha services.. Consider going to the Al Maha counter for a hassle free service.   Give your families flight iterinary to the Al Maha agent inside the arrival terminal and pay a small fee for their services.  Once your family arrives at the arrival terminal, ask them to proceed to the Al Maha outlet BEFORE the immigration counter to their left.. Tell them to announce to the Al Maha representative about their names.  They will be asked to wait in the spacious and comfortable lounge. An  Al Maha rep will collect their passports and visas and clear their immigration for them and then come back to collect your family in 10 minutes.  Your family will be lead through the immigration counter to the baggage pickup area counter where they can identify their luggages. They will direct someone to load the luggages onto a trolley and walk out near the public area where you can identify them   Cheers

Q1837	Very urgent pls pls help new born visa my baby born in qatar ,7 days old has got one year visit visa as my wife and myself both r on different sponsorship. My query is that now i want to go to india and comebck within a month. So if v live the country and comeback will there b any problem for my baby to re enter qatar as his visa is one year visit visa {as per rule they issued visit bcoz mother is not on hubands sponsorship}
Q1837_C1	RE:  Very urgent pls pls help new born visa one year visit visa ?????what is this ? somebody give u wrong information .i think this is a residence visa if visa printed as- ENTRY PURPOSE-FAMILY VIS& expiry date one year from birth date me and my wife are under different sponsor i have one year old baby and my daughters visa printed as family visit  we visit india two times last year
Q1837_C2	RE:  Very urgent pls pls help new born visa i think you're having a wrong picture in your mind. if your baby is born in qatar, he/she will NOT be issued with VISIT VISA. visit visa is issued only to a person outside qatar and for the purpose of visiting.   if you have done the birth certificate and have signed the documents at CID (due to 2 sponsers for you and your wife), your baby is issued with the RP.  I think it's better you show your babys RP (or visa as you say) to somebody who can read arabic and get confirmed.
Q1837_C3	RE:  Very urgent pls pls help new born visa Something not right here ... My husband and I are with different sponsors. Our baby was born a few months back, and was issued a family visa. Quite straightforward. The only extra step is u'll need to go to the CID office and show them ur papers. Once the baby gets his passport, u'll need to go back there with a copy of the passport. (No idea why though )

Q1898	Italians in Doha Hi,   I've just received an offer for an expat job in Doha, some 120.000$ and I'm wondering if there is an Italian comunity there  Diego

Q1898_C4	I've noticed a lot of people I've noticed a lot of people mentioning their salary on Qatarliving.   ~*Speak when you are angry and you will make the best speech you will ever regret*~
Q1898_C5	okay... seriously... I know a bunch of guys in one of the Multinational Banks in treasury who make more than that and this was two years ago... Having said that, I am no expert on finance... All I know is that these were guys with about 10 to 15 years work ex like Lorenteggio...
Q1898_C6	Loren... If its one of the national banks, the offer would be less than that of some of the multinational financial institutions... 'some'... not all...
Q1898_C7	Lorenteggio, it is alright. Lorenteggio, it is alright. You are not the first person to do so. But its just the way people could ask. Maybe something like, how much would suffice for a good life in Qatar. People on Qatarliving vary in status and the salaries vary as well. People earn QR2000 to QR 150000 a month. So, it might hurt people to know that others are making what they would save in 350 years.   Just my opinion.   I wish you a happy stay in Qatar once you arrive.   ~*Speak when you are angry and you will make the best speech you will ever regret*~

Q1898_C16	i'm not in Ciao Lorenteggio i'm not in finance so couldn'tcomment how that offer compares with the local rate, but I would say that you have to judge how much better of you'll be than at home.  Cost of living is definitely higher than in italy, but depends a lot if you have accomodation included.  you're going to pay at least QAR14,000 per month for somewhere OK to live.  If it's only a little above average salary at home then I'd say it isn't going to make you a lot better off, but this depends on your tax situation.  Not sure how the italian tax works, but no tax payable here. You have to bear in mind that while Qatar is very safe and you can buy most things here (prosciuto excepted!), it's not the most comfortable or exciting place to live. so you'll end up spending a lot on flights and holidays to stay sane. Good luck FG
Q1898_C17	To fairgrace Thank for the comment; as far as I've seen cost of living is higher here in Europe than in Qatar thanks to the strong EUR

Q2089_C3	RE: GCC Driving License You cannot drive in Egypt with your Qatari D/L, You must obtain Egyptian D/L first. Have a nice journey
Q2089_C4	RE: GCC Driving License I beleive you can still take a Interntaional Drivers Lic ense from Qatar for the time being.. :)
Q2089_C5	RE: GCC Driving License Qatar Driving License  General Qatari residents must carry a valid Qatari driving licence. GGC State Nationals are permitted to use their National Driving Licenses. As a visitor (other nationals) to Qatar, your national driving licence is acceptable for seven days from your date of arrival in the country. If you wish to rent a car for longer than the seven days (but do not intend to take up permanent residence) you will require a temporary driving license.   If you are keen to drive during your first few months in Qatar, it is worth obtaining an International Licence before you get here. An International Driving License is valid for 6 months from the date of your arrival in Qatar.  Getting a driving license depends on what country you are from. Citizens from most western countries such as Canada and the U.K. can change their drving licenses for Qatari ones. Other nationalities have to do a driving test which is actually quite difficult. In most cases the procedure for issuing a local licence just includes an eye test and a simple written test. However, it is necessary to hold a residence permit in order to apply for a Qatari driving licence.     The Procedure Temporary Driving License  The following items are required for a Temporary Driver's license (TDL):  a) Original drivers license from home country.   b) Eye examination.   c) Process fees QR156 (about $45).   d) Four personal photos (with eye glasses, if required).   e) Copy of Passport  An appointment for the eye examination will be set up for you by the HR Department and you will be informed of the time and date for the appointment.  Permanent Drivers License  Converting the Temporary Driver's License to a Permanent Driver's License requires the following:  a) Temporary Drivers License (TDL).   b) Two photos.   c) Copy of Passport and Residence Permit.   d) Process fees of QR156 (about $45).

Q2116_C1	RE: Hi there. Is it safe to work there? For women as well... It's safer than Australia for both men and women.  There are lots of kindergartens, just don't procrastinate finding one and getting acceptance.  And yes, be prepared to be stared at constantly.  Either just stare back or ignore it.
Q2116_C2	RE: Hi there. Is it safe to work there? For women as well... IN THE MIDDLE EAST THIS IS THE SAFEST PLACE AND VOID OF ANY PUBLIC INDECENCY AS IN DUBAI OR BAHARAIN.
Q2116_C3	RE: Hi there. Is it safe to work there? For women as well... don't worry, this is a safe country...being stared constantly is just a normal thing here. also, better to have a car when you're here than commuting...not only to avoid the stares but also the B.O of other passengers:( ewwwwww!!!!
Q2116_C4	RE: Hi there. Is it safe to work there? For women as well... Women stare just as much as men, particularly at Western people. Apart from the rudeness I encounter from other women occasionally, and the competition to have had the most babies, I don't find living here a problem.
Q2116_C5	RE: Hi there. Is it safe to work there? For women as well... It is safe but I was a working mum and I found these diffciulties....I had a business visa and could not sponsor a nnanny therefore I was left with maids who had company visas and or were illegal or not experienced but immediately looking foir the next jobs. I tested three but found none to satisfactory - my children were 2 and 4 so I kept them home as the fees for school a driver and the time the kids would have to get up were crazy I had a one hour commute each way so my days was wasted driving not with my kids. The nearest park to my home could be reached by car only, and the traffic sometimes made it a two hour exercise just in driving. The hospitals were OK but the public ones were accessible for appointments during work hours and the private ones expensive. I had a contract that allowed no unpaid leave and had penalties for missed work even if your kids were sick. Needless to say when my husabnd wanted to return home and resume his work and I had been unable to hire help and my son had an epileptic seizure - i gave notice and came home. As an expatriate worker with family I have found much friendly countries to work in where larger percentages of your pay stay with you and are not absorbed by high rents school fees and food prices. You need a good salary if you want to do all you want. in your contract get a vila provided and education for kids and a vihicle rent allowance and you can have an OK expat lifestyle. It depends on your salary - a labourer might be conned into coming for 280 Riyal a month - god knows how they survive. I got 14,000 + and I decided I was better taking 40,000 aud per annum salary cut and working somewhere costs were cheaper and lifestyle more family friendly  I still don't have a job but I am very happy with my decision to prioritse my kids and leave Qatar for the Qataris- mostly I found people with families where the women or both parents worked less then satisfied with the cost access to care and quality of care for their kids - People on huge salaries who can afford to join the intercontinental beach club and the wife and kids spent every after schoool moment there seemed satisfied - live in a compound with play facilities and you may be OK . Good luck.

Q2189	Wage according to nationality?? I was wondering why the european expats are being paid quadruple the salary of asians who have the same or even more experience and education??? At least thats the way it is in my work place.
Q2189_C1	This kind of practices could This kind of practices could have been paced out sooner for white collar jobs however for technical jobs it could be the different in approach and superiority to do trouble shooting and problem solving. However for companys doing a simple processes and routines, theres no reason for differences in pay.
Q2189_C2	Supply and demand, Supply and demand, capitalism 101 pure and simple. If enough well educated, well trained, well experienced, well qualified 'Asians' (Japanese usually get higher offer) refused to work for a quarter of salary of a comparable Europeans then in theory the companies will have to offer more to attract them.  Unfortunately, in practice for every Asian that refuse to work for a quarter of the European's salary there are ten more lining up to work for one-fifth.  I think the question should be re-phrased: Why would company hire a European/American/Australian/Japanese etc for four times the salary of a comparably qualified 'Asians'?????  Cheers SK
Q2189_C3	sabrang kidul, that looks sabrang kidul, that looks reasonable and probably right.
Q2189_C4	Simply frustrating discrimination! Sorry to say my friends that discriminations are well alive in this country. Most of the time Asians has more experience and even got higher degree of educations against Westerns. The sad reality is that most company are impressed with the way they look and converse in English...but of course!! that's their mother tongue. But let them write a proper business letter...most of them are unprofessional. Some company look also for the passport when hiring people. But you know what? If your company got nonsense recruitment personnel and system...they easily deceived by westerns. No offense to Western people but these point of view are based on facts...however some of them are qualified as well...not being unfair and speaking generally.
Q2189_C5	It's to do with the cost of It's to do with the cost of living in home countries and other aspects.  If you look around, on the whole, a Western Expat will get more in Asia, Russia and africa also.
Q2189_C6	Nobody is Perfect - I am Nobody is Perfect - I am Nobody  I think arabs are in awe of Europeans and afraid of them. I think maybe they feel inferior to them or do not want to look cheap in front of them so they give them more salary to show that they are also superior and can afford them.....even though the European guy maybe out of work and usless in his country and desperate to get some work here.He just wants to come here for a couple of  years to have some fun & sun and escape the cold and rain for while and spice up his resume to resettle back with some real work experience.   At least thats what i have seen in Doha for the last 10 years. I have no grouse against them nor have i been affected adversly by them at any point of  time. ........Just my opinion.
Q2189_C7	I'm asking a Hi Alexa, I'm asking a rethorical question about why would companies hire a 'Westerner' (I prefer to use this term) for 4 times the salary of 'Asians'.  According to a pure cost-benefit point of view, they would expect and should get a quadruple of productivity from the Westerner.   Question is, do they(companies or state for this matter) get what they bargained for?    The answer is (if indeed it is true that westerner are paid 4 times more, a proposition that need to be investigated further) a resounding YES, as we can see more westerner is arriving and based on the cost benefit principle above, companies feel that they still get ahead by hiring  westerners. Here we assume that no one (companies or states) is stupid enough to prefer losing instead of winning.  There's a catch though. By 'productivity' they may not only refer to  tangible things such as amount of product you produce or sales achievement. It may also  include things such as prestige (ie. this real estate company is under British management) or something as cynical (as another poster put it) fear or subconcious inferiority complex. True or nor, I don't know....  Myself, If I think I am underpaid (dont really care what my colleages get), then I'll try to negotiate a better deal. If I cannot get a better deal, then I try to prove that I am underpaid by looking at a better job that give me more. If I cannot find a better job, then may be I'm paid exactly what my market worth is....... might as well shut my mouth and enjoy......  (NOte: 'paid' here mean the total compensation I get: sallary, job satisfaction,quality of live, traffic, red tapes etc).  Enough bubling past my curfew. Adios for tonight, cheers SK

Q2189_C15	I don't see any problem with the practice ...of 'Pay for Nationality'. The labour laws of Qatar are primitive and pre industrialization practices have continued to date. Companies need to realize that the world has moved forward. The logic behind this practice is not ignorance as many would think,it is more of a feeling of applying economics around cost of living in the country of origin and extrapolating it to arrive at the salary figures. This has been taken directly from SaudiAramco.    Source:  - A study Conducted by FriedUnicorn - Vol I (September,1999)

Q2189_C23	because its called quality of work.. we have pride in what we do That is why we are getting 3 or more times the salary, we are not late to work, not sick day all the time. Pride in our work. and as stated Quality of work..  I have worked in 4 countries where it positions are for only western.  When they had Local or Asian in the job it all went to Crap so to say, I was hired to clean the place up and set it back on track. The procedures were in place but the Asians or Local where too lazy to follow the path. Safety was one of the main issues, Accountability and having the work complete not just having the box ticked.  I am happy they employ Asians here, it makes us guys look good. So thank you for your poor quality of workmanship and organization skill, you qualification may be high on paper.. But thats as far as it goes. Again. Thank you   Rules are a guideline for intelligent people, but they must be adhered to by idiots.

Q2189_C25	westerners are schooled,,, to be individualistic,,,which is not the case at all in the east,,,this allows westerners to make an informed decision on the spot... and westerners come in all colours, I was not narrowing the field to whites,,,, like it, lump it, do what you want with it, but its the truth,,, I am just being objective....
Q2189_C26	What is a Westerner ? What is a Westerner ? Someone who is from Europe, US, Canada Etc. ? or someone who comes from a developed country ? There are many of us going around whom are paid salaries that is the same as local hire or asian hire also in many countries !  Do not think it is fair to generalise that Westerners get paid more for everything. It depends on the job and scope that you are involved in.  Also bear in mind, even though Qatar is personal income tax free, some expats still have to pay taxes or other in their home countries which also accounts for higher pays.
Q2189_C27	I suppose a person on western wages... ... can't afford to spend a lot of time during the day on QL - too much work and responsibilities... and that's just ONE reason.  For once I have to agree with Jackfrost:  Quote: 'I have worked in 4 countries where it positions are for only western. When they had Local or Asian in the job it all went to Crap so to say, I was hired to clean the place up and set it back on track. The procedures were in place but the Asians or Local where too lazy to follow the path. Safety was one of the main issues, Accountability and having the work complete not just having the box ticked.'  He needs some work on his english skills but I have to agree with him. My husband has been working overseas for over 30 years now and the responsibility will only be given to somebody who can take the shit the position makes you go through and actually deal with it. You need to be firm, have capacity to argue the necessary points and leadership personality. And unfortunately there are a lot of people who lack these requirements.

I am willing to put my education and knowledge to the test against any of the western expatriates working here in similar field and there won't be much difference.  As for someone mentioning above that Indians come here because they can't get job anywhere else, well I work for the same company here for which I was working in India, the company which picked me from my campus so maybe the desire of not leaving that company got me here rather than any lack of job opportunity.     <a href="http://s1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/?action=view&current=angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

Higher cost of living back home matters as most of the expats are working here to save money and one day go back home to settle down with their savings here.      <a href="http://s1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/?action=view&current=angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

Q2189_C37	I have a basic question. For I have a basic question. For how many Indians, middle east is first choice for work? Usually, those who work here are already rejected from US and european countries ( and 70% are rejected by their own country) I don't know about other fields, but the doctors working in middle east are substandard compared to their own counterparts in India and the european doctors are even more substandard to these already substandard doctors.    Now, the conclusion is that quality control is a joke here. Employing few europeans (and one or two Americans) makes things look good. But they can't afford more than few and so they employ majority asians at cheapest rates to be cost effective, And the end result is a substandard organisation which spends lots of money, has poor performance and manipulated quality control( usually through media).   Are you nuts?......no doubt I am crazy about you!
Q2189_C38	Quite clearly,you haven't Quite clearly,you haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about & you haven't interacted with a lot of educated,informed,well travelled NON-WESTERNERS...probably has something to do with the fact that you're a racist bigot...THERE'S an informed decision...from a NON-WESTERNER...deal with it...
Q2189_C39	/-a-t-/ sun26872...middle @ sun26872...middle east is first choice for MANY Indians so you're completely wrong about that one,for a lot of Indians,they don't mind coming to the mideast 'cos it's just a 3hr. flight from home,earnings are tax-free & there are a lot of people from their community/town/village...they can't find that in the west,it's too cold from them for half the year or more,it's halfway around the world & no way would they be able to afford that 16 hr. flight ticket once a year like they do here & they pay tax on their earnings,put yourself in their shoes,would the west still be your first choice?...i thought not...You are right about the fact that most of the good Indian doctors(& India produces some of the best on the planet as i presume you know already) choose to stay @ home or go west but it would be unfair to say that because of that ALL Indian doctors in the mideast are substandard or the European doctors here for that matter...a lot of them move,again for the tax-free income,to try a new place,a new lifestyle,a life partner who's based here,there are so many things that factor into that descision... Quality control as you rightly stated is in most cases a joke but again that doesn't apply across the board...a well trained person,wherever it is they are from,is unlikely to compromise on standards...

Q2189_C44	if you knew my salary if you knew my salary ,Jackfrost, you will get a frostbite.     I am agree with everyone that if you have signed a contract, you shouldn't complaint. Likewise, I maintain that Europeans and Americans working here are of inferior quality than their Asian counterpart, but I don't have a problem with that too because their salary doesn't come from my account.   Europeans are very good only in one aspect that they can convince people of their lies.But I personally consider a great quality to be a convincing liar because nothing succeeds like money. I wish we Asians learn to stop working hard and start convincing people of our leadership qualities and individualism. But then who will do the real work?  Are you nuts?......no doubt I am crazy about you!

Q2189_C53	To make it easy for some people to understand I will give you an example that might show you a reason why lets say Filipinos as mentioned in this thread are earning little bit less than other nationalities:  Check this address, or else read below my comment to one filipina lady who envy others who get more than her husband: http://www.qatarliving.com/node/825227  X is a civil Engineer from Manila working in W Consturction Company and earning 5000 USD per month.  Y is a civil Engineer from US working in W Construction Company and earning 7500 USD per month.  Both X and Y has 13 years experiance in thier field.  Why X earns 5000 USD and Y earns 7500 USD per month?  Discrimination?  My opinion is:  - X needs to work in W Construction Company for 5 years to save money for buying a house back home in the Philippines.  - Y needs to work in W Construction Company for 15 years to save money for buying a house back home in the US.  - X has one son only who goes to Z university( One of the best well known expensive universities in the Philippines)where the fees are 30 000 peso (2300 QR!!) per year.  - Y has one son also who goes to G University(which is one of the humble small universities in California) where the fees are 20 000 USD (73 000 QR).  - X has a wife working in Kuwait with one son only and a mistress in Manila and a gf in Qatar. He has to support himself only and maybe send some gifts for his son from time to time.   - Y has a wife who is taking care of 6 children back home and he is the only one responsible for the whole family.  - If X is single and would like to get married, it won't cost him more than lets say 100 000 Peso (7600 QR) for one of the best wedding in a luxarious Cruise in the Ocean.  - If Y is single and originate, but a Muslim, he can not get married with less than 100 000 USD (365 000 QR) due to how expensive are weddings in the US, Hotels, Wedding Planner Companies, The Mahr (might reach millions) which is supposed to be given to the wife as a gift to buy all what she needs and would love to have.  Many Empployers know these facts and many others when recruiting staff.  If any of us is not satisfied with his job, then he better go straight home, or is it only Jelousy and Envy? For what? Although his income is more than yours, most probably you got better life than him back home. Better House, Your kids are enrolling in better schools and universities...etc  So please enough Envy.
Q2189_C54	maybe the answer is how much you have negotiated your salary? I have one main principle regarding this story: you are asking for an amount. If you are receiving what you have asked for, why are you complaining. If the offer is lower, why have you accepted it? On the other hand I know a lot of Indians or Iranians that are paid better than me. So, maybe is not the nationality. Each of us consider himself the most beautiful/handsome, the smartest, the most skilled etc. person. Maybe is not true, have you think about this??

Q2189_C63	Agree with my exiled friend Agree with my exiled friend (hope I can call you a friend). It is not racism per se but rather a nationalism, pasportism or perhaps  Jawaazsafarism (please correctt my Arabic).  In many companies  Mr Tendulkar  will get the same package as Mr Collingwood eventhough he just get his british passport last week. However without an Australian passport Mr Afridi will not get the same as Mr Ponting despite the fact that he had lived, study and work all  his live there.  Oh well, in the end no one force us to sign that dotted line and no one (I assume) hold our passports and prevent us to say goodbye.  Cheers SK
Q2189_C64	On a general level, On a general level, westerners seem to be able to DEMONSTRATE better levels of leadership and trouble shooting. (Just see how many countries are there in the west that are poor/under developed/developing compared to Asia/Africa. and its not that they have an advantage of natural resources or climate over others)They can also sell themselves well. They also tend to grasp the bigger picture well, compared to the Asians who excel in specialising in a particular discipline of study. But then, this is only a generalisation.  This is not to say there arent any asians who cant do the same. Whether you look at Mittal/TATA/SONY etc and what they have achieved in the west, the Asians who work at high profile jobs in western countries or the IIM/IIT graduates who are almost completely recruited by western companies, there are enough proofs for Asian talent and capabilities.   But the issue is that, due to the problems intrinsic to the demographics of Asian population, there is quite a sizeable chunk of the population who have not been fortunate enough to get the same kind of education and exposure that their more fortunate counterparts could attain. This particular section, which is quite sizeable, tips the balance when it comes to the general world view of the quality of asian workforce.  Also, I am not quite sure how it works out in the west. Do they pay less for asian employees, like here in the middle east?  if not, that is another pointer, which could tell us that the workforce from Asia that ends up in gulf(that includes yours truly)is somehow the ones that couldnt make it in their own homes or in the west. It could also mean the ME perception of Asians has a hand in this.  Before accusing anybody of RACISM in this matter, what the Asians should think about is, what exactly weighs in favor of the westerner and how to make the same factor work for them. Its not skin, its more than passport, its the BRAND that has been created around it.  Like how sony made it in the west.Morita knew how to combine creative, cost-effective engineering (their core philosophy) with product marketing and brand creation.End of the day, its about brand creation.   As much as I have seen brilliant managers from west, I have also seen ones who have reached that position simply by virtue of their passport. That is what you call brand value.(Not saying that there arent local/Asian managers who have been lucky in a similiar way, for them its other reasons) Have we reached a place where we are ready to launch that brand that would do half the selling for us? Till then, Asians will have to put up with lesser pays.  Coz like everything, one day,  "this too shall pass"

Q2189_C66	Estong,If westerns were Estong, If certain westerns were offered what certain Asian countries pay their citizens, I don't think that you would have a single one of those westerners working here.

Not saying that this is correct but its one of the factors that ME does what they do and gets away with it!

Q2189_C74	mohammed - Typical Asian Mentality, your employer is not your provider. Stop being envious, Hasad will deprive you fragrance of Jannah  Abu Tharr may Allaah be pleased with him said: "I heard the Messenger of Allaah sallallaahu `alayhi wa sallam said: `When forty-two nights are passed, Allaah sends an angel to the nutfah (embryo) and he gives it shape, forming its hearing and sight, its skin, flesh and bones. Then he says: `O Lord, male or female?' Then your Lord decrees whatever He wills and the angel writes it down.'" [Muslim]   Another hadith  "Each one of you comes together in mother's womb for forty days, then becomes an 'Aalaqah (clot) for a similar period of time. Then he becomes a Mudhghah (chewed lump of flesh) for a similar length of time. Then Allaah sends an angel to him, who is commanded with four things. It is said to him: Write down his deeds, his provision, and whether he is doomed (destined for Hell) or blessed (destined for Paradise). Then the soul is breathed into him.'"   Al-Bukhaari

Q2189_C82	Nic, no problem I can take it even if it was for real. My point was just: "if you don't like it who's keeping you here? There are two full lists for every of us regarding pro- or anti- working as an expat. We are the sole responsible for our acts and decisions. I could work in Germany for almost the same money as here. Part of my decision was to gain some ME experience and to live in a more quite environment.

Q2189_C83	Laurana,Honestly, the only Laurana, Honestly, after all the professional frustrations I've been through here, the only reason that retains me in this country is the money! I can ensure you that ME experience is NOT an asset and it is often seen as a disadvantage when you'll try to reintegrate the western job market. It is well known in the west that the professional standards in the ME are very low. There are several reasons, just to name a few: blind localization and promotions of unqualified, non-competent and uneducated local people in lead positions; low work-force salaries, non-existent real HR policies, etc... Nobody is motivated here to pursue a career as all know that won't happen...and so many more... in summary this is not a normal country where hard work, innovation, leadership and results are rewarded accordingly. This is a country where the wealth pours out of the soil, regardless people being hard working or being passive and do the minimum to get the most... the second scenario is the actual reality and the locals are to lazy or to incompetent or the hopeless to control this disgrace.

Q2189_C87	It depends on the company, It depends on the company, and the contract. In my company, the position dictates the salary and there is some "wiggle room" in negotiating a higher salary or benefits if you bring something spectacular to the table (like great negotiating skills, I guess).  I don't know how it is elsewhere, but I guess my question is: if you are so unhappy with your contract, why did you sign it?
Q2189_C88	Laurana People who complain why others get more than them are usually social climbers who can't eat back home, and once they come here they forget about thier origin and start comparing themself with others.

Some expat communities in Qatar have some kind of marriage officials over here, whether it is at their embassies or outside.  In my case, since my wife and I are of different nationalities, we could not get married at the embassy.
Q2232_C3	IchWill - some laws in this IchWill - some laws in this country just amaze me. different rules for diff nationalities for the same issue. at the end of the day it all boils down to money...dont understand why they cant just take the cash and make things simpler!!!!
Q2232_C4	tinkerbell As far as the family court is concerned only one law applies to all nationalities. They genuinely did not care what our nationalities were. They only care about religion... I am not saying that is any better.
Q2232_C5	Ichwill - yeah that Ichwill - yeah that too....case to case scenario actually. in this instance yes its religion but there are many other issues pertaining to visas etc and every nationality has something diff to produce. believe me the ppl sitting at the counters themselves have differing opinions on what papaers need to be submitted for what....recent hair raising exp with my labour card....&^&&%
Q2232_C6	i know....plz dont remind i know....plz dont remind me...im yet to get out of that nightmare and thank god i have it done now...:-(  but yes one good thing that came out of that nightmare is now i KNOW the exact procedure (as long as they dont change anything in the next 24hrs!) .....:-)
Q2232_C7	Britey - if u cud sue them i Britey - if u cud sue them i wud...cannot...:-(( i wish they had tied me down with chains and refused to sign that blessed paper...:-((  IchWill - this rule is for those who have diff sponsors. Reason being the sponsor is responsible for his employee.
Q2232_C8	It is a violation of a basic It is a violation of a basic human right. Responsibility or not. The freedom of choice of a partner is not available in this country. It is, indeed, modern slavery again.

Q2232_C10	britexpat; britexpat; yes, someone who was employed by a company here and on a seperate RP.  Employer / Sponsor has NOTHING to do with marriage of employee.  Provided both bride and groom have valid RPs in Qatar, the family court in Qatar will only ask for a letter of approval from the father of the bride if he is not physically present in the court during the wedding, and an attested/translated civic record or something that proves the bride is not married. In addition to doing a medical test and bringing 2 witnesses to court, there is nothing else to it.  However, keep in mind that the family court here will only marry a Muslim male to a Muslim or Christian female. They will not carry out the marriage of the groom is not a Muslim or if the bride is not a Muslim nor Christian.  Only one exception to this rule: Female cabin crew working at Qatar Airways.
Q2232_C11	Yes Ichwill i did get married Yes Ichwill i did get married here according to our religious rites and then had to get a formal one done at our embassy and submitted the NOC to my embassy and attested it. when i had my child here i had to submit a similar letter stating i was sponsored by my company to HMC.....
Q2232_C12	britey - that happens when britey - that happens when both have diff sponsors....i had to give one too many yrs back.
Q2232_C13	Well QL teaches us something Well QL teaches us something new every day.. Why should the company care who you marry ?  What if they said No ?  Anyway, i don't want to hijack his post..   Visionint : Good Luck
Q2232_C14	Bet you regret it now, don't you tinks;-P  Wish that your company never issued NOC?
Q2232_C15	Xena - dont remind me...;-(( Xena - dont remind me...;-((
Q2232_C16	I agree with Tinkerbell10. A I agree with Tinkerbell10. A colleague of mine had a similar issue and had to get an NOC. I did wonder myself at that point in time why this was necessary. But now I understand it is because of the difference in Sponsors.

Q2310	EDITING/DELETING COMMENTS Lately I found out that author of threads can self regulate their thread.  I mean, the author can edit/delete unwanted comments as the author wish to!  Is this true or as I understand it that only the Moderators can do the editing and deletion of another person's comment!  As I understand it also, one can edit his/her OWN comment but never other's comment! Does this policy holds true?
Q2310_C1	How did you find this How did you find this out.  As far as I'm aware thread authors can not edit other peoples comments.  For example, can you edit this comment?

Q2581	Chaging work before the end of the 1st year is it possible to change jobs during your first year in Qatar?  The current sponsor will give release and NOC.
Q2581_C1	qatarisun ..Written Approval I suggest he/she secures a written approval or some evidence to testify his employer will release them.  Another QLer posted that after he dropped the legal case he filed against his employer, who previously agreed to release him but didn't pay his dues, they turned against him and denied the agreement.  Better be careful.  Salam
Q2581_C2	Given the situation Hi Fado   Given the situation between a certain two countries I would not if I was you. I have heard of people being asked to leave Qatar within 48 hours after asking for a transfer.  You should inquire with other people from your home country here and they can fill you in on it. Its politics again!
Q2581_C3	Not possible... You may have the NOC on hands from your current sponsor, but the Immigration will not allows you to change your sponsor, when you did not completed a 1 full year work visa with the same sponsor. And working with another company not your sponsor is certainly illegal.
Q2581_C4	Apple If I'm working for 6 months to may current sponsor and i will resign with NOC (release paper from my sponsor). As per advice to my next sponsor that i will exit to point of origin and they will just send the new visa & plane ticket this is possible?
Q2581_C5	bingbong That is possible. But your visa should be cancelled by your sponsor and you need "NOC to return within the 2yrs banned period".  Note: NOC to transfer sponsor is different from NOC to return w/in 2yrs banned period.
Q2581_C6	Apple who will provide the "NOC to return within the 2 yrs banned period"? is it the sponsor or immigration. Tnx
Q2581_C7	Definitely, your current Definitely, your current sponsor. :)
Q2581_C8	Apple Did you experience this situation coz I discuss the issue of some HR-PRO the give me different answer the other one give me 95% assurance that I will not be banned but other PRO give 100% assurance that it will be ok to transfer to other sponsor. with this two different assurance one thing the are in common that I will exit to my country of origin and back here in Doha for new visa.
Q2581_C9	You will be banned for 2yrs You will be banned for 2yrs once your RP is cancelled, which is why you need to reassure that your current employer will grant you an NOC to return. Please note that your RP must be cancelled prior to exit, otherwise your new employer wont be able to apply a new visa for you.  Once you exit the State, and with an NOC on hands, things will be fine with you, in God's will!  But changing sponsor within a year working of the same sponsor with a work visa/permanent visa stamped on your passport and without EXIT will not be possible for you as per Immigration Rules. You can double check with your company's PRO, though.
Q2581_C10	fado...Very Difficult Before or after a year, its difficult to grant you one, specially if your employer is Qatari.  Be careful please.   Salam
Q2581_C11	I doubt if you will be able to change sponsorship within the first year. That was the answer I was given when I tried in 2004 even though the company were prepared to give me an NOC and I had another job and sponsor lined up.
Q2581_C12	.....Apple, Dweller ..... Yes, it is possible. I have seen a guy, who changed after 8 months of his joining.  In that case,   1. THe first sponsor did give an NOC 2. The second sponsr was a strong, reputed one  In the abvoe criteria, it can be possible.
Q2581_C13	guys, no need to doubt it! I guys, no need to doubt it! I HAVE CHANGED the sponsorship within 1 year. I PERSONALLY. As the matter of fact, my RP was just "5 month old" at that time...  Apple, NOC is NOC. It means the previous sponsor does not mind you to work for another company. You can either transfer your sponsorship right away, even within 1 year, sometimes even without leaving qatar, or you can leave Qatar, to find another job and come back any time without waiting till 2 year ban is over. All the guy needs is NOC letter. And hey, it's better not to belong to very few nationalities when as someone said, he might be asked to leave qatar within 48 hours. But this is a different story and has nothing to do with NOC, or duration of work with the previous sponsor. Some people try to just renew  their RPs and asked to leave country. So get a NOC and good luck with your new job! <i> <b> ********************* You become responsible forever for what you have tamed.

Q2581_C14	QS, you are always special QS, you are always special dahlin, no doubt on that ;))  Now I have this thoughts in mind, does the Law based on some nationalities too? Because normally, like Dweller said, you cannot made it possible w/in a yr.? at least that's what we've been told.
Q2581_C15	Apple, someone asked me Apple, someone asked me once: what are the immigration/labour rules in Qatar? My answer was simple: Rule #1 (and often the only 1): "There are NO rules". What is perfectly working for one, irrespective of  ones nationality, gender, age, religion, political preferences, etc., might not working for another, irrespective of anothers nationality, gender...see above :)... Moreover, whatever worked for one person once, might not work for the same person next time (with the same name, same passport number, same nationality, same gender.. see above.. ) So, when the questing starts from "IS IT POSSIBLE...?", the answer is "EVERYTHING is possible". And that was my point, dear :) how are you anyway? Long time    <i> <b> ********************* You become responsible forever for what you have tamed.

Q2581_C16	QS :) Oh! very well dear, tnx for asking :)  You seemingly right. It just appears to be the rules doesn't really applies to everyone. But then, allow me to add one more rules here, that is sooo common.   Rule #2 "Wasta" :P
